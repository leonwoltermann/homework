<milestone unit="sentence" n="277" />His has been not only the grovelling last of the demagogue for selfish elevation, but a Satanic determination to unmake his country if necessary to the making of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278" />He deliberately chose the demoralization and disorganization of society as the means of elevating himself, until he at last succeeded in undoing the work of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0" authname="washington"><surname full="yes">Washington</surname></persName>, and in rending the old Republic in fragments, that he might perch his dwarfish figure upon the colossal rules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279" />Other statesmen have identified their names with some measure which, in their opinion at least, promised to increase the greatness and glory of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281" />If he has any genius, it is for destructiveness, for pulling down not building up. He has the countenance of a vulture and the instincts of <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282" />He has sought to overthrow those Institutions of the <rs>Southern States</rs> which had given wealth and power to the whole nation; but has he ever had the capacity to propose anything in their place?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287" />The reward of his iniquity is not yet secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288" />If the war of invasion should fail, the arch traitor will sink to a deep of infamy, even in his own section, compared with which the reputation of <persName n="Arnold,,Benedict,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="default:Arnold,Benedict,,," authname="arnold,benedict"><foreName full="yes">Benedict</foreName> <surname full="yes">Arnold</surname></persName> is honor and renown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289" />So far from being <rs type="role2">President</rs>, he would not be able to live in his own State, and might consider himself lucky if he escaped with his head to foreign exile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290" />No man is more sensible than himself of the personal consequences of failure, and it is to save himself from the gulf of perdition that yawns at his feet, that he is urging on with convulsive energy the blood- hounds of war. It is not the least of the many stimulants of the <rs>South</rs> to the most determined resistance, that the defeat of the <rs>Yankees</rs> will be the personal and political ruin of the wicked author of the troubles we are suffering, who, keeping himself aloof from the trials and perils in which he has involved others, can receive no other retribution in this world than the final disappointment of that ambition which has led him to the perpetration of the most unparalleled crimes. </p> </div3>
