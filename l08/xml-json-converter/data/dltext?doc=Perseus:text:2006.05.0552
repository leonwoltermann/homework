<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />He said, after a review of the doctrines of allegiance held in various countries, that they illustrated nothing that would control Courts here, and that every Government had the power of prescribing and perfecting its own system of granting citizenship; no rule of international law was laid down or adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />In view of this fact it was proper to ascertain the law of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> on the subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" /> At the time of the secession of the <rs>State</rs> the law of citizenship was controlled under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />This was not a compulsory act, but a gift of privilege to be accepted by residents of foreign birth in the nature of letters patent, under the <rs>English</rs> system, where citizenship was <hi rend="italics">ex donatione regis.</hi> The persons not desiring to become citizens were required to give notice of the fact by filling in the <rs>Clerk</rs>'s <orgName>Office of the Courts</orgName> their papers to that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />The reason of this was obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />The status of each individual was important to be known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" /><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> was desirous of ascertaining all who disregarded the obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />Under this ordinance the petitioner became a citizen of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>; he was within the scope and jurisdiction of the law, and failed to file any paper of contrary import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />As a sovereign power, the <rs>Judge</rs> held that <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> had the right to pass the law, for questions of citizenship were solely and exclusively within her own mode and manner of legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />That military service is the duty of the citizen of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, is too plain for argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />The <num value="1000">thousands</num> who to-day endure the hardships of the camps and the perils of the field attest it. The petitioner being a citizen by act of the <rs>Convention</rs> and his own acceptance, then he is liable to military duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />If they owed allegiance to foreign powers when <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> passed her act of citizenship, why did they not say so?--In the opinion of the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, men of foreign birth in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> at the time of secession, owe their allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> by reason of their citizenship in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and the act of the <rs>State</rs>, and should have no exemption from the duties devolved upon other citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />It was, to say the least, too convenient a method of casting upon others the defence of their homes property, and families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />It would be showing too timid a respect for the rights of foreigners to release them from military duty, when, under the laws of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, no difference is known between her citizens, from whatever clime they hail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />In return for the immunity, privileges, and protection granted and guaranteed to them, they must recognize an allegiance which is legal, and should be natural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />This was no time for adopted citizens to falter on the road of duty.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277" /> A writer in a contemporary journal, who approves of the <rs>President</rs>'s Message in that part relating to the conscription, says, in substance, that we have already men enough — that large armies are unwieldily, and therefore not apt to render so much service as small ones — that as a proof, <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0" authname="xerxes"><surname full="yes">Xerxes</surname></persName> failed in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas" authname="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,," authname="napoleon,louis"><surname full="yes">Napoleon</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya" authname="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278" />The general inference is, that we shall do better with a small army than with a large <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279" />The philosopher who maintained that <num value="0.5">a half</num> was greater than the whole, is not, it seems, without disciples. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280" /> <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0" authname="xerxes"><surname full="yes">Xerxes</surname></persName> failed with a great army, and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,," authname="napoleon,louis"><surname full="yes">Napoleon</surname></persName> failed with a great army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281" />Innumerable <hi rend="italics">small</hi> armies were destroyed during the <measure n="22centuries" type="date">twenty-two centuries</measure> that elapsed between the death of the <num value="1">one</num> and the birth of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282" />Why the fate of these last should have been wholly overlooked in the construction of a general rule deduced from example of military failure, we are at a loss to imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283" />But before we give our assent to the startling proposition that the larger the army the more certain the failure, it would be well to inquire a little into facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284" />How were the <rs>Northern</rs> barbarians enabled to break the <rs>Roman Empire</rs> into fragments?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285" />By their numbers unquestionably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286" /><persName><foreName full="yes">Alaric</foreName></persName> marched a the head of half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, and <persName n="Attila,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Attila,nomatch:0" authname="attila"><surname full="yes">Attila</surname></persName> lost <num value="300000">300,000</num> in a single, battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287" />What enabled the <name>Saracens</name> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and the <rs>Ottoman Turks</rs> afterwards, to overrun <placeName reg="Asia" key="tgn,1000004" authname="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242" authname="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, plant the <rs>Crescent</rs> on the towers of St. Sophia, and shake Christendom to its centre?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288" />Their numbers, beyond all doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289" />It was by their numbers again that the <name>Tartars</name>, under Genghis Khan, in the <num value="13" type="ordinal">thirteenth</num>, and Timour in the <num value="14" type="ordinal">fourteenth</num> century, swept over half the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290" /> But let us come down to that period in modern history which affords the best illustration of on subject; we mean the wars of the <rs>French Revolution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291" />The Republic successfully withstood the assault of combined <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292" />How? By virtue of her numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294" />Under the <rs>Empire</rs>, the military force was always enormous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297" />The distance from home, the climate, the rugged resistance of the <name>Russians</name>, the difficulty of procuring supplies — and other causes might be enumerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298" /><persName><foreName full="yes">Charles</foreName> <genName n="12" full="yes">XII</genName></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> century before, failed quite as badly as <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,," authname="napoleon,louis"><surname full="yes">Napoleon</surname></persName> did in <dateStruct value="1812--" full="yes" authname="1812"><year reg="1812" full="yes">1812</year></dateStruct>, and his army was little more than <num value="1">one</num>- <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> part as large as that of the latter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299" /> Decisive battles are usually fought by a very small proportion of the entire force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308" />There is a case directly in point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309" />The Poles fought as gallantly as it was possible for men to fight, but their army was comparatively small, and they were conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310" />It is extremely difficult to conquer a people thoroughly united and resolved to do their utmost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311" />To conquer such a people as ours we hold to be impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312" />Still it is best, we take it, to have as many troops in the field as can be maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313" />If we can best the present force of the enemy, with the <num value="600000">600,000</num> added, very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314" />Still, we do not see that a force doubly as large as that we now possess would do us any harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315" />Had we had such a force last year we should not now be lamenting the ravages of the enemy in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and elsewhere.--Physical strength, let it be underrated as it may, is a great thing in all wars — more especially in such a war as that in which we are engaged. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
