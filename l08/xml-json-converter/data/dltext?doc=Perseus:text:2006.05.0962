<head>The Lesson of the hour.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330" /> There are those who regard this as the most dismal and discouraging period of the whole war. The minds of many are in consonance with the sombre aspect of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331" />The skies are overclouded, the trees are leafless, the birds are silent, the earth is frozen and seemingly lifeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332" />We do not deny that this is a serious and even solemn crisis, and we will admit that not even in the gloomy days of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee" authname="tgn,7017741">Fort Donelson</placeName> and New Orleans were there as much grounds for grave and anxious feeling as now. But what are the causes of this solicitude?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333" />They are to be found chiefly in ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334" />It is not that the enemy has gained great military advantages; these calamities can be repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335" />It is not that our soldiers have lost their ancient courage; they are the same firm and faithful warriors who have on a <num value="100">hundred</num> battle-fields borne the flag of the <rs>South</rs> in victory and saved the freedom and independence of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336" />But, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337" />the harmony and mutual confidence that made us once a band of brothers have been rudely assailed, and the demon of discord seems to have full possession of the minds of some of our public men. There are those who seem more intent upon fastening the responsibility and odium of misfortunes upon this and that public agent than upon devising means of remedy and relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338" />There are <num value="1000">thousands</num> in private life who, instead of devoting themselves body and soul to the salvation of their country, are absorbed in the pursuit of private gain, gambling wildly upon the deck of the storm-tost vessel, whilst the hurricane is howling fiercely through the shrouds and the roar of the breakers is in their ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339" />These are the things, more than the power of the enemy, that fill the minds of active and reflecting men with sad and serious thoughts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340" /> We have never been the indiscriminating eulogists of men in power, nor blind to faults and errors, which they have undoubtedly committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341" />This journal was never, under the old Government, a party journal, and its ancient freedom from party associations is a feature in it which we do not propose to abandon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342" />But to err is human, and we are therefore disposed to make all allowances for the men at the head of our affairs, upon whom such responsibilities have been cast as never before fell to the lot of public men on this continent, and rarely upon public men in the history of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343" />The American Revolution was mere child's-play compared to the gigantic struggle which is being waged on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344" />Its largest army would scarcely have formed the advance guard of <num value="1">one</num> of our mighty hosts.--The combined military and naval power brought against it during the whole war by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> never equalled that which assailed the single town of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023" authname="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345" />A nation has been born in a day, and, at the instant of its birth, it has been called upon to do the work of a giant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346" />When we consider the comparative strength of the <num value="2">two</num> combatants at the beginning of this war, when we bear in mind not only the disproportion of population, and of military and naval armaments, but the deplorable deficiency of mechanical skill and labor in the <rs>South</rs>, we are filled with amazement at the results which have been accomplished, and instead of despairing over the loss of so much of our territory, wonder, and thank a benignant <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952" authname="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, that any of it is left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347" />The people and the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>South</rs> have accomplished more in this war than any other people and Government mentioned in the annals of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348" />If we had possessed the men and means, if our people had continued patriotic, and if our rulers had been infallible and never made mistakes, the war might perhaps have been ended <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago. But who can say that, if it had thus ended, its fruits would not have been lost?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349" />Who can say that we might not even now be considering the question of reconstruction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350" />If we had found the independence so promptly and easily obtained, it would have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance in the history of the world where a nation which has obtained its independence with facility has not lost it as easily as it was procured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351" />We do not make these remarks to palliate the political and military blunders which have caused our misfortunes, but to suggest to our people that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952" authname="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> may have a beneficent design in protracting this struggle, and intend thereby to render our separation from the <rs>North</rs> complete and eternal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352" /> But, admitting that our Government has committed errors, are not these errors exceptional?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353" />Are not its intentions patriotic?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354" />Can we single out in our own minds any man who would have done better than <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0" authname="davis"><roleName n="President" full="yes">President</roleName> <surname full="yes">Davis</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355" />and who, even if he had avoided the errors which he has committed, might not have fallen into others of equal magnitude?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356" />It is easy, after events have transpired, to show what ought to have been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357" />But, if the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> has not the gift of foreknowledge as well as infallibility attributes which belong only to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, which of our other citizens can lay claim to these qualities?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358" />And, if the <rs>Government</rs> has been at fault, can the people show clean hands?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359" />Are they blameless?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360" />Have they preserved the purity and patriotism which animated them at the beginning of this struggle?--On the contrary, has not a universal madness for greed and gain seized upon the entire population?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361" />Have not the cities run wild with speculation and extortion, and the farmers, once the proverb of disinterestedness and patriotism, demanded such enormous prices for their productions that the efficiency of the army and the welfare of the country have been both put in peril?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362" />Who, who can raise his hands at this solemn hour, in all the broad limits of the country, and say he is blameless?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363" />What class of confederates, but the army, can raise their hands to Heaven and say: Behold them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364" />There is no blood on these hands but the blood of the enemies of the country!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365" />there is no pulsation in these hearts but that which beats for her welfare! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366" /> In the name of all that is good and holy, for the sake of our firesides and our liberties, let us banish the fell spirit of discord and stand by our country and our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367" />No earthly good, nothing but evil, misfortune, ruin, can come from criminations and recriminations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368" />The <rs>North</rs> has hushed up its internal broils to support a man like <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00202" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>, who is not the choice of a majority of his people, in the work of subjugating the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369" />Can we not support such a man as <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00203" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0" authname="davis"><surname full="yes">Davis</surname></persName> in the work of defending our hearths and homes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370" />If the wrong man is <rs type="role2">President</rs>, <hi rend="italics">who put him there?</hi> Who elevated him unanimously?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371" />Let us be charitable to the child of our own creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372" />For our own part, with all his errors, we believe him <num value="1">one</num> of the foremost men of the continent in administrative capacity, and no purer patriot lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373" />No other man has as much interest as he in faithfully performing his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374" />Let us only exercise a generous confidence in him and each other, let Government and </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375" /> people endeavor in the future to avoid the errors of the past, and the future will be as bright and cheerful, the winter of our discontent will pass away, and a glorious spring rejoice our hearts. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
