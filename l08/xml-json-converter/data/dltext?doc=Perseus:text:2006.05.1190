<milestone unit="sentence" n="240" />It has recovered its spirits and discipline in a remarkable degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241" />It is in position in the enemy's rear, upon his only line of communication; it is strongly fortified, and is calmly awaiting for the enemy to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243" />But it is impossible that he can have collected more than enough to last him a very few weeks, seeing that he has but <num value="1">one</num> railroad to bring them over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244" />He must either advance to <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498" authname="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> or <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444" authname="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, or he must fall back and sweep <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0" authname="hood"><surname full="yes">Hood</surname></persName> out of his way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249" />To fall back; on the other hand, in the direction of his supplies, would be equally hazardous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250" />He would, in that case, be compelled to fight <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0" authname="hood"><surname full="yes">Hood</surname></persName> entrenched up to his chin, or to get around him by flanking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253" />His only hope, it seems to us, would lie in reinforcements to come through <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580" authname="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> from beyond the <rs>Ohio</rs>, and they would have to run the gauntlet of <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0" authname="forrest"><surname full="yes">Forrest</surname></persName> and the guerrillas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256" />The idea obtains that the truce was general as to place, and that it was proposed by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:1" authname="sherman,w.,t."><surname full="yes">Sherman</surname></persName> in order to overreach <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0" authname="hood"><surname full="yes">Hood</surname></persName> and gain some advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257" />This is a mistaken view of the subject, as will be seen by reference to the terms of the truce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258" />The suspension of hostilities between the <num value="2">two</num> armies was limited to Rough and Ready and its immediate neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259" />It did not include <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331" authname="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> nor <placeName reg="Jonesboro, Clayton, Georgia" key="tgn,2023284" authname="tgn,2023284">Jonesboro</placeName>', nor any other point but the above-named station on the <orgName n="Macon Railroad" type="railroad">Macon railway</orgName>, and a limited space around it. This station had been agreed upon as the place for the delivery of the exiles from <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331" authname="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> and the exchange of prisoners, just as <placeName reg="Fuquay-Varina, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074737" authname="tgn,2074737">Varina</placeName> below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was selected as the point of exchange in this part of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260" />It was perfectly permissible to <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0" authname="hood"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Hood</surname></persName>, at any time during the truce, to attack <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:1" authname="sherman,w.,t."><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Sherman</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331" authname="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, or for the latter to move upon him at <placeName reg="Jonesboro, Clayton, Georgia" key="tgn,2023284" authname="tgn,2023284">Jonesboro</placeName>', if either had been so inclined, or in a condition to undertake offensive operations. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265" />The enemy is putting forth all his strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266" />He has, in his own conceit,--to which there is no limit — imagined that this is the time for "crushing the rebellion."

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267" />He is straining every nerve to do this:--all the <rs>Yankees</rs>, all the foreigners, all the <hi rend="italics">negroes,</hi> that he can bring into the field, he is marshalling, with an utter indifference to human life, under the butchers which command them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268" />To meet this increased exertion, these swelling numbers of the invader, our own Government has called upon the people to rally to the assistance and reinforcement of our brave armies, which have for so many months held him at bay. They are responding to the call, and the country will be triumphantly defended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269" /> Is not this encouraging to us all?--Should not every true-hearted man, as he marches to the field, derive cheerfulness and confidence from the very measures which call him there?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270" />He sees that the <rs>Government</rs> is in earnest, and determined to save the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271" />He sees that such exertions, on our part, are necessary, because the enemy is making greater efforts for our subjugation than at any time since the war began.--Therefore, instead of being dispirited because our Government is putting forth its own strength with more vigor than ever, he is cheered and gladdened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272" />To remain passive, to make not a single effort more than has been made, while the enemy is concentrating all his vast resources, with unparalleled energy and malignity, against us, would be suicidal and imbecile, if not treacherous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273" />To meet the occasion like men is the only way for the <rs>Government</rs> to acquit itself with good faith to the country — to rally to the public defence with alacrity and courage — the only manner in which the citizen can discharge the solemn duty to his country which is next in dignity to his duty to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274" />Then these proceedings — these movements of the <rs>Government</rs> and the <name>People</name> — shed a halo of brightness over the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275" />They give sign of the coming event, like those which have followed every exigency of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> since the war; a triumph by the exertion of the national strength proportionate to the emergency.
