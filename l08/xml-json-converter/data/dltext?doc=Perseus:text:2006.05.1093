<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />The reports of the demoralization of the <rs>Federal</rs> army are apparently well grounded, and it may be that he has sought this locality which, under the protection of the gunboats, he can recuperate his shattered strength, and get the courage of his men up to the fighting point; though the more probable supposition is that he design is crossing to the <rs>Southside</rs>, somewhere in the vicinity of <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477" authname="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />A few days ago a piece of artillery was placed in a position to play upon this observatory, and, it is reported, succeeded in striking it once or twice, but before much damage could be done the enemy's batteries compelled a removal of the gun. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278" /> They have ever deeply deplored the necessity which constrained them to take up arms in defence of their rights and of the free institutions deliver from their ancestors; and there is nothing they more ardently desire than peace, whensoever their enemy, by ceasing from the unhallowed war waged upon them, shall permit them to enjoy in peace the sheltering protection of those hereditary rights and of those cherished institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279" />The series of successes with which it has pleased Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in so signal a manner, to bless our arms on almost every point of our invaded borders since the opening of the present campaign, enables us to proless this desire of peace in the interests of civilization and humanity without danger of having our motives misinterpreted, or of the declaration being ascribed to any unmanly sentiment or any distrust of our ability fully to maintain our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280" />The repeated and disastrous checks, foreshadowing ultimate discomfiture, which their gigantic army, directed against the capital of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, has already met with, are but a continuation of the same providential successes for us. We do not refer to these successes in any spirit of vain boasting, but in humble acknowledgment of that Almighty protection which has vouchsafed and granted them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281" /> The world must now see that <num value="8000000">eight millions</num> of people, inhabiting so extensive a territory, with such varied resources and such numerous <unclear /> for defence as the benignant bounty of nature has bestowed upon us, and aminated with <num value="1">one</num> spirit to encounter every privation and sacrifice of ease, of health, of property, of life itself, rather than be degraded from the condition of tree and independent States into which they were born, can never be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282" />Will not our adversaries themselves begin in feet that humanity has bled long enough; that treats and blood and treasure enough have been expended in a bootless undertaking, covering their own land, no less than ours, with a pall of mourning, and exposing them far more than ourselves to the catastrophe of financial exhaustion and bankruptcy, not to speak of the loss of their liberties by the despotism engendered in an aggressive warfare upon the liberties of another and kindred people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283" />Will they be willing, by a longer perseverance in a wanton and hope loss contest, to make this continent, which they so long boasted to be the chosen abode of liberty and self government, of peace and a higher civilization, the theatre of the most causeless and prodigal effusion of blood which the world has ever seen, of a virtual relapse into the barbarism of the ruder ages, and of the destruction of constitutional freedom by the lawlessness of usurped power? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284" /> These are questions which our adversaries will decide for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285" />We desire to stand acquitted before the tribunal of the world, as well as in the eyes of Omniscient Justice, of any responsibility for the origin or prolongation of a war as contrary to the spirit of the age as to the traditions and acknowledged maxims of the political system of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286" /> On this continent, whatever opinion may have prevailed elsewhere, it has ever been held and acknowledged by all parties that Government, to be lawful, must be founded on the consent of the governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287" />We were forced to dissolve our federal connection with our former associates by their aggressions on the fundamental principles of our compact of union with them; and in doing so we exercise a right consecrated in the great charter of American liberty — the right of a free people, when a Government proves destructive of the ends for which it was established to recur to original principles and to institute new guards for their security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288" />The separate independence of the <name>States</name>, as sovereign and co equal members of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, had never been surrendered, and the pretension of applying to independent communities; so constituted and organized, the ordinary rules of coercion, and reducing rebellions subjects to obedience, was a solecism in terms, as well as an outrage on the principles of public law </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289" /> The war made upon the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was, therefore, wholly <num value="1">one</num> of aggression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290" />On our side it has been strictly defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291" />Born freemen, and the descendants of a gallant ancestry, we had no option but to stand up in defence of our invaded firesides, of our desecrated altars, of our violated liberties and birthright, and of the prescriptive institutions which guard and protect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292" />We have not interfered, nor do we wish in any manner whatever to interfere, with the internal peace and prosperity of the <name>States</name> arrayed in hostility against us, or with the freest development of their destinies in any form of action or line of policy they may think proper to adopt for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293" />All we ask is, alike immunity for ourselves and to be left in the undisturbed enjoyment of those inalienable rights of "tile, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness," which our common ancestors declared to be the equal heritage of all the parties to the social compact </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294" /> Let them forbear aggression upon us, and the war is at an cad. If there be questions which require adjustment by negotiation, we have ever been willing and are still willing to enter into communication with our adversaries in a spirit of peace, of equity, and manly frankness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295" />Strong in the persuasion of the justice of our cause, in the gallant devotion of our citizen soldiers, and of the whole body of our people, and above all in the gracious protection of Heaven, we are not afraid so avow a sincere desire for peace on terms consistent with our honor and the permanent security of our rights, and as earnest aspiration to see the world once more restored to the beneficent pursuits of industry and of mutual intercourse and exchanges, so essential to its well-being, and which have been so gravely interrupted by the existence of this unnatural war in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296" /> But it our adversaries, or those whom they have placed in authority, deaf to the voice of reason and justice, steeled against the dictates of both prudence and humanity by the presumptuous and delusive confidence in their own numbers, or those of their black and foreign mercenaries, shall determine upon an indefinite prolongation of the contest, upon them be the responsibility of a decision so ruinous to themselves, and so injurious to the interests and repose or mankind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297" /> For ourselves, we have no fear of the result.--The widest pictures ever drawn of a disordered imagination comes short of the extravagance which could dream of the conquest of night <num value="1000000">millions</num> of people, resolved with <num value="1">one</num> mind" to the freemen rather than live slaves," and forewarned by the savage and exterminating spirit in which this war has been waged upon them, and by the mad avowal of its patrons and supporters, of the worn than <placeName key="tgn,7016833" n="1.000 10" reg="Misr,Africa" authname="tgn,7016833">Egyptian</placeName> bondage that aware them in the event of their subjugation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298" /> With these declarations of our dispositions, our principles, and our purposes, we commit our cause to the enlightened judgment of the world, to the <unclear /> reflection of our adversaries themselves, and to the column and righteous arbitrament of Heaven. </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376" />But allowing, as we do, no such supremacy to <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432" authname="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>, we are entirely at a loss to understand why there is so much anxiety in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to know what the <rs>English</rs> people think of us. We are sure of <num value="1">one</num> thing at least, and that is, that whatever may be their opinion, they can do <hi rend="italics">us</hi> no good if favorable, and no harm if the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377" />We see that their Government is decidedly against us, and as that Government professes to be a popular Government, under the control of the people, we might infer that the people themselves are against us likewise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378" />Yet we are continually feeding ourselves with the belief that the <rs>English</rs> people love us dearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379" />What if they do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380" />They will do nothing for us, and this is no time for empty professions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381" /> We published yesterday a series of extracts from <name>English</name> papers of every shade of politics with regard to the battles in <placeName reg="Spotsylvania, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2114316" authname="tgn,2114316">Spotsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382" />The sameness of the whole batch is so striking that any person might be excused for thinking they were all written by the same person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383" />The reason of the strange likeness is evidently that they all derive their information from the same sources, and those sources hostile to us. The Yankee newspapers throughout this war have been their historians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384" />How they represent us and our cause we all know well enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385" />We have just had ample specimens in the telegrams of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00266" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0" authname="stanton"><surname full="yes">Stanton</surname></persName>, which <hi rend="italics">we</hi> know to be a tissue of the most barefaced lies ever presented to a people who do not wish for truth, if it be unpalatable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386" />But of this the <rs>English</rs> newspaper writers know nothing, for they only rarely, and at long intervals, see our papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387" />For that reason they almost invariably get a false impression of the actual state of affairs, and upon the impression thus derived they base their articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388" />In these very articles, for instance, every <num value="1">one</num> of them speaks of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="nearbymention:Grant,H.,,," authname="grant,h."><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName>'s "splendid strategy," as if it had ever once compelled <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,," authname="lee,fitz"><surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName> to abandon a position before <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="nearbymention:Grant,H.,,," authname="grant,h."><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName> himself had withdrawn from his front; as if it had ever once compelled <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00270" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,," authname="lee,fitz"><surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName> to give way; as if, in every case, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00271" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,," authname="lee,fitz"><surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName> had not <hi rend="italics">followed</hi> <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00272" reg="nearbymention:Grant,H.,,," authname="grant,h."><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName>, instead of retreating before him. The tone throughout would lead to the inference that <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00273" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,," authname="lee,fitz"><surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName> was falling back to his defences around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, with an army still strong, it is true, yet beaten in every engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389" />In a word, these papers but repeat the tale of the <rs>Yankees</rs>, which everybody here knows to be a monstrous falsehood, and which is now showing itself to be such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390" />With all their experience of <name>Yankee</name> mendacity, at each repetition they yield the same credence that they did in the beginning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391" /> The <rs>Yankees</rs> have always been more sensitive to the opinion of the world than any other people we are acquainted with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392" />We had always believed that the people of the <rs>South</rs> were comparatively indifferent, and we are sorry to see that evidences of the contrary begin to appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393" />The Yankee is the vainest of all animals — it is <num value="1">one</num> among their many national failing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394" />They wish all the world to believe that they are the most <rs>Valliant</rs> and most refined nation on the earth, that New York is the greatest of all cities, and that <persName n="Boston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00274" reg="mostcommon:Boston,nomatch:0" authname="boston"><surname full="yes">Boston</surname></persName> is the <rs>Athens</rs> of the modern world, and they are constantly calling upon foreigners to admire their mighty empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395" />The South, on the contrary, has never laid claim to any particular species of greatness, and is therefore not liable to the rude shocks which Yankeedom sometimes meets to its vanity in the disallowance of its claims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396" />True, it has produced a Washington and a Lee, a Marshall and a Henry, a Jefferson and a Calhoun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397" />True, the only <hi rend="italics">statement</hi> of the old Union came form within her borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398" />Her valor has been sufficiently illustrated in this war to place her on a level with any people that ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399" />But she invites, on this account, no comparisons, and we cannot see why she should care <num value="1">one</num> farthing for the judgment of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or any other country.
