<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />Some suppose the design is actually to attack the city; but to us, that seems preposterous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" />Others think with more appearance of probability, that it is intended merely to keep up an excitement and draw off men from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,," authname="lee,gen"><surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

Nevertheless, we can imagine a very good apology for such an order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />He tells us further that the <rs>Yankees</rs>. "admit that our tire was very destructive, and the accuracy of our guns unequalled. " This was very candid in the <rs>Yankees</rs>, and the confession is worth its weight in gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />It would have added greatly to the interest of the story had the reporter been pleased to tell how this <name>Yankee</name> confession was gotten at, how it came to be made, and who was the happy man that received it.--The <rs>Yankees</rs> are generally very reticent in such matters, and much more prone to underrate then exaggerate the losses on their side and the <unclear /> of their enemy.
