<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85" /> The Yankee Colonel replied, "if we have <num value="4">four</num> to your <num value="1">one</num>, we shall whip you. If we have <num value="3">three</num> to your <num value="1">one</num>, it will be a drawn battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86" />If we have only <num value="2">two</num> to your <num value="1">one</num>, we shall be whipped." This account we have from the <rs>General</rs> in person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87" />It is stated on high authority, too, that the prisoners of rank freely assert, that it <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,," authname="grant,gen"><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName> is whipped in this fight, he will find it impossible to keep up his army, and the war will be virtually over. </p>

This shows that the panic of some of the <rs>Yankees</rs> at least, and the haste and confusion of others must have been great. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89" /> The voices of the subaltern officers of the enemy could at times be distinctly heard by our men behind the entrenchments (ours), at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entreating the men to fight; telling them that it was necessary to fight well only once more, whip <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,," authname="lee,r.,e."><surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName>, and that then the rebellion would be crushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90" />As entreaties failed, and the flagging spirits of the motley crew <sic>refussal</sic> to respond to the eloquence of these leaders, threats and curses, loud and deep, succeeded, and in some instances the officers used their swords pretty freely on their men. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99" /> Numbers of the sober once who were in the advance had their knapsacks on, and after being made prisoners were asked by our troops, "how did you expect to fight such a battle as this encumbered by your knapsacks?"

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375" />As "Sallust" explains, in his letter published by us yesterday, the only road left him before he is thrown below the head of the <placeName key="tgn,1126952" n="1.000 10" reg="Mattaponi, Virginia, United States" authname="tgn,1126952">Mattaponi river</placeName>, where he must cross several large streams, is what is now called the <placeName reg="Telegraph, Kimble, Texas" key="tgn,2107972" authname="tgn,2107972">Telegraph</placeName> road.
