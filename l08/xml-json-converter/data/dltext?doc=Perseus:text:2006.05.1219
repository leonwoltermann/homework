<milestone unit="sentence" n="328" />We hardly ever met with a man, however ignorant upon general topics, and however willing to confess his ignorance, who did not conceive that, upon this particular <num value="1">one</num>, the hardest of all to master, he had a peculiar <hi rend="italics">gift.</hi> Hence the incomprehensible schemes and projects that have been enacted into laws by our legislative bodies, State and Confederate, from the combined operation of which it is wonderful that our currency has escaped with even the semblance of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334" />The Government must pledge its faith to this effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335" />Next, the notes are to be exempt from taxation — the stupid measure of taxing them having already worked a vast deal of mischief.
