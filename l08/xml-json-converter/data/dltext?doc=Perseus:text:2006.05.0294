<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" /> The weather here is very stormy, and judging from appearances and the direction of the wind, we shall probably have another storm, which will be specially annoying to the transient visitors to <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina" authname="tgn,3000601">Hatteras</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />I learn that during the storm that occurred some <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> ago, the cowardly Hessian troops there were nearly washed away, the tide rising several feet over the low and narrow piece of sandy land which they are holding in terrible suspense, until they shall be captured by the dauntless Southerners who are determined to drive them from the sod of the <orgName n="Old North State" type="newspaper">Old North State</orgName> as soon as they are ready to strike a blow that will teach the intruders a lesson never to be forgotten. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" /> I learn that the soldier who was so severely wounded a few days ago by balls fired from a revolver by an officer, has died; but as I have no direct information from the hospital to which he was taken, the report may not be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />I believe it is generally conceded here that the shooting was justifiable in this affair, and may be regarded as a case of self-defence, as it is thought the unfortunate man would have made a desperate assault with his bowie knife had he not been so promptly disabled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" /> Much concern is felt here about the scarcity of coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />The supply of anthracite having been exhausted some time since, and transporting bituminous coal here from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> or <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404" authname="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is attended with considerable expense; besides, the grates and stoves are mostly adapted to the burning of hard coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />Soft coal, as it is called, is selling here at 35a37<measure n=".5cents" type="currency">½ cents</measure>. <persName n="Wood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Wood,Robert,,,:1" authname="wood,robert"><surname full="yes">Wood</surname></persName>, however, is plentiful — standing in the forests, if not for sale on the docks; and although the article is rather high, there needs be no great fear that our people will suffer from cold on account of the want of fuel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" /> The Independent Grays, of this city, express their sincere thanks to the ladies of the <rs>Episcopal</rs> <orgName n="Soldiers Aid Society" type="society">Soldiers' Aid Society</orgName>, for a much-needed supply of blankets and many other favors unexpected and unsolicited, and <q direct="unspecified">"bestowed so quietly and with such grace as to make them as forgetful as possible of their indebtedness."</q> In their card of thanks, the <rs>Gray</rs>'s very appropriately add: </p> <cit><q rend="break" direct="unspecified">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" /> Verily, the efforts and valuable assistance rendered by the ladies of the <rs>South</rs> in behalf of those who are battling for liberty cannot be over-estimated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />Their labors, personally and assidously, for the comfort of the soldiers, their words of encouragement, and the genial influence of their smiles upon our brave troops, in their struggles in the holy and righteous cause of freedom, will form many a thrilling chapter in the history of the present war, and descend far down the track of time, to be remembered by generations to come, to live in song wherever the voice of civilization shall be heard, or deeds of love, mercy, and heroism shall receive the award of merit and praise by the enlightened, the good, and the brave. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" /> War matters are unusually quiet hereabouts at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />The discharge of great guns is but seldom heard, and all the preparations for conflict are going on with but little noise or excitement. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" /> There are some rumors here of extraordinary arrangements and extensive preparations going on at the <rs>North</rs> for the hopeless work of subjugating a great nation, such as building ships, collecting troops, concentrating forces, provisions, equipments, horses, &amp;c., &amp;c. Meanwhile, the indomitable and vigilant men of the <rs>South</rs>, here and elsewhere, are getting ready for any emergency or any attempt of the enemies of liberty and civilization to carry out their iniquitous designs upon those who only desire an honorable and peaceful separation, and the enjoyment of those rights and privileges to which they have asserted a just and well-established claim. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256" /> Last night was <num value="1">one</num> of the worst we have had for some weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257" />The rain fell in torrents, with an occasional intermission, during which the wind whistled dismally through the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258" />The storm ceased about <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> this morning, after which it turned excessively cold, and thick overcoats and blankets came into general demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259" />So much in a metereological way, and now to the situation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260" /> Yesterday morning heavy firing was heard in the direction of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, but what the meaning of it was, I am unable to say. As our advance lines are visible from the observatory in <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159" authname="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>, we could see plainly it had nothing to do with our movements, or standings, perhaps, I should say, for nothing in the shape of a movement has yet been discovered even by the crowd of rumor-seekers, who catch eagerly at every omen, and read signs of a battle in the straws that fly upon the autumn wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261" />Every morning we are gratified by the presence of a few regiments which are on the way to or from picket duty; the streets are constantly filled with transport wagons; dragoons and couriers dash about; soldiers lounge around the town; time goes on very quietly; and that is the extent of our knowledge as to army movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262" />It may be superfluous to say that we live in a constant state of expectation, and are anxiously waiting, like <persName n="Micawber,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Micawber,nomatch:0" authname="micawber"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Micawber</surname></persName>, for <q direct="unspecified">"something to turn up."</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263" /> Last night the <orgName type="regiment" key="MS19">19th Mississippi</orgName>, a very large and fine regiment, passed through the village on their way to do picket duty some <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> below here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264" />Poor fellows, how they must have suffered during the cold and stormy night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265" />This morning the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA1">1st Virginia</orgName> started, also, for picket duty, and at an early hour we were roused by the music of their band as they passed through the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266" />They will bivouac near the <name>Accotinck</name>, about a mile from <placeName key="tgn,7015783" n="1.000 8" reg="annandale, fairfax, virginia" authname="tgn,7015783">Annandale</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267" />Yesterday some scouts went into <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532" authname="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, but found none of the enemy there, nor could any signs of them be seen in the vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268" />His principal strength seems to be in the direction of <placeName reg="Munson's hill">Munson's hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269" />The fine grove of trees I mentioned in a previous letter upon the summit of <placeName reg="Taylors Hill, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2713343" authname="tgn,2713343">Taylor's hill</placeName> has been destroyed, and the fortification on <placeName key="possibilities=11" n="1.000 10" reg="," authname="possibilities=11">White's hill</placeName>, which we called <placeName reg="Fort Walton">Fort Walton</placeName>, extended to that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270" />The pickets on each side remain as they did a week ago in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Falls Church, Falls Church, Virginia" key="tgn,2111722" authname="tgn,2111722">Falls Church</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271" /> Sometime ago the ladies of <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921" authname="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName> completed a box of clothing for the soldiers, and forwarded it to the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA17">17th Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272" />The articles were well chosen, well made, and of excellent material, consisting of jackets, pants, shirts, and other substantial <rs n="wearing apparel" type="product">wearing apparel</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273" />As cold weather was close at hand, and as the boys were not in good winter trim, the box and its valuable contents was voted a <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-send.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274" />The scene which occurred when the clothing was distributed was pleasant, and could the kind ladies of <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921" authname="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName> have been near enough to have witnessed it, they would have been amply repaid for their trouble, setting aside the feeling of duty that prompted their labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275" />On some portion of each jacket and pair of pants an inscription had been written by the maker, and these had to be read in turn around the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276" /><num value="1">One</num> little fellow had a nice, warm jacket, which he displayed to his comrades as proudly as a boy does his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pair of boots, or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pants with pockets in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277" />On the inside was written-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278" /> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> will never be conquered while her sons rally around her standard! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279" /> <q direct="unspecified">"My God!"</q> said the fortunate soldier, contemplating the nice garment at arm's length, <q direct="unspecified">"I never could run with that jacket on."</q> The other day I heard a story very similar in <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Louisiana</rs> camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280" />Sitting around the fire an officer read a letter from home which said that flannel was scarce, and very dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281" />Considering this, the ladies, who would remain in the warm <rs>South</rs>, had determined to cut up their flannel skirts to make warm shirts for their <q direct="unspecified">"dear boys"</q> in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282" />The thought that they were so kindly remembered at home, caused pleasant emotions, and many an eye was moistened as the mind reverted to the generous sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283" /><q direct="unspecified">"Who wouldn't fight with such a shirt on?"</q> was the remark of a listener.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284" />With or without a shirt, those men will never prove cowards; for the thought that the ladies of their State remember them so kindly, is a sufficient talisman to guide them to the post of duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285" /> Last week an Irishman deserted from the <rs>Federal Dragoons</rs>, while on picket duty, and came into our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286" />He says he has long desired to escape, but has never before had an opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287" />His brother is in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, and he wished to join him; but where he was, or in what State he enlisted, the deserter did not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288" />He was detained a prisoner until the authorities found time to examine into his case, and meanwhile was sent to <placeName key="tgn,2015942" n="1.000 10" reg="Manassa, Conejos, Colorado" authname="tgn,2015942">Manassa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289" />On arriving there he was taken to the guard-house, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight that met his eye was his brother lying on the floor, sleeping off a drunken spree, which caused his arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290" />He was not too drunk to recognize his brother, and for half an hour the old building resounded with their <q direct="unspecified">"ba gorras,"</q> and <q direct="unspecified">"arrahs,"</q> and fairly trembled at the violence of their hand-shaking. --Both men are now on duty in our ranks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291" /> This evening the gallant <persName n="Rosser,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0" authname="rosser"><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Captain</roleName> <surname full="yes">Rosser</surname></persName> and his company of artillery returned from <placeName key="tgn,7015783" n="1.000 8" reg="annandale, fairfax, virginia" authname="tgn,7015783">Annandale</placeName> and reported to <persName n="Walton,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Walton,nomatch:0" authname="walton"><roleName n="Major" full="yes">Major</roleName> <surname full="yes">Walton</surname></persName> at the main encampment of the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292" />He left everything very quiet below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293" />The object of this visit is, I understand, to form a more perfect organization of the battalion, after which <persName n="Rosser,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0" authname="rosser"><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Captain</roleName> <surname full="yes">Rosser</surname></persName> will return again to the outposts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294" /> The heavy rain of last night caused such a rise in <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988" authname="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> that it was not thought advisable to run the stage to <placeName key="tgn,2015942" n="1.000 10" reg="Manassa, Conejos, Colorado" authname="tgn,2015942">Manassa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295" />I am of opinion, however, that the mall, or a portion of it, went down on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296" />A splendid military bridge is being constructed over the run at <placeName reg="Blackburn's Ford">Blackburn's Ford</placeName>, the site of the battle of the <date value="07-18" authname="--07-18">18th July,</date> The work is under the superintendence of <persName n="James,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:James,nomatch:0" authname="james"><roleName n="Major" full="yes">Major</roleName> <surname full="yes">James</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256" authname="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, and will be completed in a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297" />It is very ingeniously framed, with piers and abutments of logs, and covered with heavy <milestone unit="column" n="5" /> plank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298" />This bridge will be of great service to the army, to the people of <placeName reg="Fairfax, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,7014160" authname="tgn,7014160">Fairfax</placeName> and <placeName reg="Prince William, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,7015778" authname="tgn,7015778">Prince William counties</placeName>, and will reflect great credit upon the skill of the engineer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299" /> A strange propensity exists among the troops near here to appropriate to their own use any little articles found lying around loose that they may happen to fancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300" />The principles of <hi rend="italics">meum</hi> and <hi rend="italics"><unclear>tuum</unclear></hi> are not very strictly adhered to. Chaptains, in their sunday sermons, are accustomed to call these little elips of the fingers <q direct="unspecified">"stealing;"</q> but that seems a harsh term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301" /><q direct="unspecified">"Confiscation"</q> will do very well, when applied to a stranger; but when a friend has to be deprived of some valuable, it is done on the socialistic theory of <q direct="unspecified">"equalization of property."</q> <persName n="Tomlinson,Mister,Augustus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="default:Tomlinson,Augustus,,," authname="tomlinson,augustus"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Augustus</foreName> <surname full="yes">Tomlinson</surname></persName> used to moralize, while relieving a traveler of his purse, that it was no harm to take from the rich to give to the poor.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317" /> We were visited by another heavy fail of rain during the early part of this week, which caused a considerable flood in the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> at this point, though I have heard of no serious damage along this river or canal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318" />The same cannot be said, however, as regards the <orgName n="Virginia and Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia and Tennessee Railroad</orgName>, as the bed of that road has been much damaged in many places, (some of which have been repaired;) besides which several bridges have again been washed away over <placeName reg="Peak Creek, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2572644" authname="tgn,2572644">Peak creek</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Pulaski, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002183" authname="tgn,2002183">Pulaski county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319" />The railroad crosses this serpentine mountain stream, if I am correctly informed, about <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> times, and at <num value="1">one</num> of these crossings the earth washed from the tressel work on <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> last; and while the eastern-bound freight train was passing over on Tuesday the tressel work gave way and precipitated the locomotive and <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> cars, loaded with sugar, coffee, and other valuable stores, into the creek, some <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> deep, which was at that time swollen by the rains which had fallen to the dimensions of a river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320" />Fortunately, the engineer and other train hands escaped a watery grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321" />The loss in valuable stores, however, will be considerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322" />Every exertion is being made to get the road passable for the trains, and it is hoped, in view of the great importance of this line being kept open, that the structure over this troublesome creek will be rebuilt in such a manner as to be proof against the periodical freshets which it seems are inevitable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329" />A case in point occurred not more than a month ago.

Such a spirit cannot be too strongly condemned, and it should be made the especial business of the press everywhere to cry down this practice of speculating on not only the necessities of the times, but actually the wants of the suffering, and in many instances of the very men who are now exposed on the tented field to the inclement storm, and have risked all, even life itself, in defence of our liberties. </p>
