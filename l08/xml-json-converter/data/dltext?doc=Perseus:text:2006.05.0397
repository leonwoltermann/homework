<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />This will be gratifying intelligence to all who have friends in the <name>Peninsular</name> army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" /> The re-enlisting of volunteers goes Bravely on, and you may rent assured that before the present time expires a large number will have enrolled their names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" />The battle at Somereset, and subsequent retreat of our army there, has, so far from disheartening our troops given an impetus to re-enlisting, and an assurance of future success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" /> Among the many efforts being made of increasing our army, is <num value="1">one</num> down here which will render <hi rend="italics">more</hi> effective a valuable arm of our service — that of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />For we have been thus early informed by the gailant <rs>Captain</rs> that the required number has been nearly, if not entirely secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />It is also proposed to increase this body to a battalion, and the hope is foundly cherished that <persName n="Vaughan,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Vaughan,William,R.,," authname="vaughan,william,r."><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Capt.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Vaughan</surname></persName>, by pushing forward in this effort will succeed in raising a battalion of <q direct="unspecified">"mounted men."</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" /> Such an organization, made up principally as it will be of residents of, and those who have been operating in this section, must prove most efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />A battalion thus organized, the men thoroughly familiar with the woods and by-pathe, will, by acting beyond the outposts, keep back marauding parties of the enemy, who is even now burning and plundering the property of exited citizens of that section. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" /> By keeping the enemy in his entrenchments much will be accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />If he should come out in large numbers, then our brave men will have an opportunity of meeting force by force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />As a large number are already enlisted in this enterprise, we sincerely trust — indeed, believe — that <persName n="Vaughan,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Vaughan,William,R.,," authname="vaughan,william,r."><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Captain</roleName> <surname full="yes">Vaughan</surname></persName>'s efforts will secure a battalion of mounted men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" /> On the <date value="01-15" authname="--01-15">15th of January,</date> Captain Fleet, finding it necessary for some purpose, directed a yacht which was in the vicinity to be removed from <num value="1">one</num> point to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />The <rs>Yankees</rs>, having caught a glimpse of the yacht, immediately started in pursuit with the larger steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />This rendered it necessary that the yacht.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" />in order to escape and reach a place of safety, should run into <placeName key="tgn,2060620" n="1.000 11" reg="sturgeon, boone, missouri" authname="tgn,2060620">Sturgeon</placeName>'s creek, where the men who were in her went ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />When the steamer came up opposite to the mouth of the creek, <num value="2">two</num> boats, with about <num value="20">20</num> men in each, were dispatched for the purpose of capturing the yacht, while she continued to shell the shore for a mile up and down, in order to protect her boats; which, having advanced within <measure n="300yards" type="distance">300 yards</measure> of the nearest cannon, <rs type="role">Capt.</rs> Fleet opened fire on them with canister; whereupon they immediately wheeled about and returned with the utmost precipitation to the steamer, which now resumed her fire with redoubled efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />This he did with great promptness and effect in the mean time, the small steamer having come to the aid of the large <num value="1">one</num>, they both kept up for some time a furious cannenade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224" />A fleet of nearly a <num value="100">hundred</num> sail and an army of <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> men, with guns and equipments in profusion, were esteemed equal to the capture of any exposed piece of waterbound land like the <rs type="place">Island</rs> in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232" />It remains to be seen whether such be his real design, and with what success he will prosecute it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234" />In such an undertaking, the enemy's vessels could be of little direct use. The water approaches to that city from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709" authname="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> are too narrow, tortuous, and easily obstructed, to admit the use of vessels, and if the enemy attempts a land attack, the chances in our favor of repelling him are <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235" />The reduction of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231" authname="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> would be the work of months, and could only be effected by a large increase of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0" authname="burnside"><surname full="yes">Burnside</surname></persName>'s forces, an increase which the <rs>Yankee</rs> exchequer is not able to afford for an operation stretching through a protracted period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236" />Nothing at all can save their Treasury, and nothing can keep the war on foot, but rapid operations and decisive successes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242" />The true consideration is, whether such successese repay their cost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243" /> Messured by this standard, the achievements of the <rs>Burnside</rs> expedition are not likely to be very important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244" />Its cost cannot have been less, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance, than <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> of dollars, and its charget every day are at least <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a <num value="1000000">million</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250" />The injury they inflict upon us is local and remediable, that which they bring upon themselves in debt and taxation, is general, universal, and enduring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253" />Parents and kindred at home are writing patriotic letters to the young men in camp, who are responding to their appeals in the most gratifying manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254" />It is not the volunteers who are so much to be appealed to in this case as their kindred at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255" />If these latter do but say the word, there is not <num value="1">one</num> volunteer in <num value="10">ten</num> who will not re-enlist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256" />It is said that some of the officers in the field are discouraging re-enlistments in their companies and regiments, desiring themselves a pretext to leave the service of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257" />The officers who would act so base a part never would have joined the service at all, if they had not, by mistaken use of the appointing power, been seduced into the service by tempting commissions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258" />But <num value="10">ten</num> times stronger than the influence of these unworthy characters is that of appeals from home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259" />Let but this latter influence be exerted by our patriotic fathers, mothers, and young women, and the cause of the country will be safe beyond contingency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260" /> Really, the inducement is very great indeed which urges our farmers and yeomen to exert this influence upon their sons in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261" />If the <rs>Yankees</rs> should succeed, as they now aim to-do, in fastening their enormous debt upon the <rs>South</rs>, even in equal share with themselves, our country is utterly ruined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262" />The land would literally groan under taxation, and scarcely any man could call himself solvent, for scarcely any of the leading pursuits of the country would get through the year without debt after paying taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263" />Submission to the enemy would be ruin outright; and our farmers and planters have nothing to do but fight the battle through to the bitter end. This they are more determined upon now, if possible, than at any former period of the war. </p> </div3>
