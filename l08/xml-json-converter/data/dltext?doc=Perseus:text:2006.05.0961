<milestone unit="sentence" n="140" />This remonstrance is endorsed by the <rs>Presidents</rs> of the <rs>Wilmington</rs> and <rs>Weldon</rs>, <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631" authname="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Manchester</placeName>, and other roads of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141" />The following is an extract from this remonstrance: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142" /> It is the idle dream of theorists and declaimers to substitute disabled soldiers, or others incapable of military service for men educated for, and employed in, these pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143" />The simplest of them requires far more peculiar skill and experience than the inexperienced can be made to understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144" />And nothing is more certain than that men unfit for military service are wholly unfit for the employment on railroads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145" />Actual experience has established this beyond doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146" />This blind zeal to put every male in the army can only increase the number to be fed, armed, and clothed, while it destroys the only resources for transporting troops, food, arms, or clothes for them — already inadequate for the armies of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147" />At this time, with the existing laws and military regulations, the efficiency and capacity of every railroad in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is very greatly diminished for want of suitable men to operate and keep them in repair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148" />The employment of inexperienced men produces confusion, and multiplies collisions and accidents, while the want of mechanics keeps a large portion of machinery and cars useless for want of repairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149" />Take any considerable number of the railroad employees remaining, and the operations of the railroads must cease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150" />Let the <rs>Government</rs> undertake to carry them on with disabled soldiers, boys, or old men, without experience or skill, and but a few months or weeks will suffice to show the last train run on the last railroad in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151" />No agencies have been more efficient and necessary in carrying on this war than the railroad companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152" />Adopt the measures proposed, and not only will you inflict widespread loss on stockholders, (many of them soldiers in the army,) but you put an end to railroad transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153" />What substitute for it can be had?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154" />It requires <num value="1000">one thousand</num> wagons and drivers, and <num value="4000">four thousand</num> horses, to transport in <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> what a railroad train can in <num value="1">one</num>, or <num value="5">five</num> times that number to do it <num value="1">one</num> day. Where are these to come from, when enough for the other wants of the army cannot be had? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155" /> With those best acquainted with the condition and resources of our railroads, including the officers of Government having special charge of railroad transportation, it has been long a subject of most anxious consideration by what means these agencies can be maintained in operation with every fostering care and aid which the <rs>Government</rs> can bestow on them, and all are oppressed with the apprehension that not a few of them must be abandoned with each successive year of this war. What, then, must be the result, and how soon must it occur, when the <rs>Government</rs>, instead of fostering, still further cripples and destroys them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156" />Already the <rs>Government</rs> has a Bureau of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> superintending railroad transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157" />Let the officers of that bureau be consulted as to the effect of the proposed measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158" />They are impartial, and they are informed on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159" />But let not a blind seal for swelling the numbers of the army, or a prejudice against railroad companies (who were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to sustain the <rs>Government</rs> by offering to perform its transportation at half rates of toll, and to receive payment in Government bonds and notes when they had no market value) precipitate the country and its armies into irretrievable disaster. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263" /> We should before this time have indicated our opposition to the passage of the resolution proposed by <persName n="Phelan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Phelan,nomatch:0" authname="phelan"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Phelan</surname></persName>, in the <name>Senate</name>, which suspends the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> had we not felt assured that it would never pass through Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264" />We are still of that opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265" />Nevertheless, as there is nothing certain in this world, and as the resolution in question may have more friends than we are aware of, we feel it our duty to express our views upon it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266" /> The writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> is the great instrument by means of which we are enabled to maintain our personal liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267" />It is a writ directed by a Judge to the proper officer, commanding said officer to bring before him or some other <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> a person who has been imprisoned, and has made complaint to the <rs>Judge</rs> that he has been thus imprisoned without cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268" />It applies to all cases of unlawful seizure and detainer of the person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269" />When the prisoner is brought before the <rs>Judge</rs> he hears his case, and if he think there is no cause to detain him he is released.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270" />If he think there is cause to detain him he is sent back to await his trial. --To suspend this law is to make the <rs>President</rs> a Dictator — to clothe him with the same power that is possessed by the despotic princes of continental E <unclear>e</unclear> --to render him utterly irresponsible to any power on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271" />With this power the <rs>President</rs> may to-morrow imprison any man, woman, or child within the limits of this Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272" />He may shut up the prisoner where he never can be heard from, and that, too, without his ever knowing what he is charged with.--The repeal of the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> extinguishes, indeed, all law, or rather places all law in the hands of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273" />There is nobody in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> whom he cannot seize and imprison without assigning any reason for the act, and without permitting him to be heard in his own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274" />He can send files of soldiers at night to the lodgings of every member of Congress and seize them in their beds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275" />He can do the same by the <rs>Judges</rs> and the members of the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State Legislature</orgName>, and, if they should ever be heard of again, they can never have an opportunity to speak in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276" />He can break up the press by arresting those who conduct it, and thus extinguish the great lights of freedom — a free press, an honest Judiciary, and an independent legislature — at a single blow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277" /> We are far from thinking that <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Benjamin,,," authname="davis,benjamin"><roleName n="President" full="yes">President</roleName> <surname full="yes">Davis</surname></persName> contemplates any of these things, when he applies, through the <rs>Senator</rs> from his own State, for this power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278" />We believe he would use that power as judiciously as any other man would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279" />But no man ought to be entrusted with it, not even <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0" authname="washington"><surname full="yes">Washington</surname></persName> himself, were he alive, <rs type="role2">President</rs>, and desirous to obtain it. We can see no necessity for the grant of any such power at this time, or at any time, and while we believe it repugnant to the feelings of the people at large we are unable to see that the grant would in the smallest degree ensure to the benefit of the cause which we are struggling to maintain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280" />As a proof of what the people, in <num value="1">one</num> State at least, think of the matter, we may mention that the <name>Legislature</name> of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659" authname="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> has already passed a bill rendering the refusal of a person having another in custody to obey this writ and produce his person, or preventing him from free communication with counsel, a felony, punishable by <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> confinement in the penitentiary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281" />We hope Congress will take care not to endanger the present relations of the several members of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> by coming in contact with the rights of the <name>States</name>, in this instance so significantly expressed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282" /> The pretext for repealing the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> is the better enforcement of the proposed conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284" />It proposes to abolish all the exemption laws heretofore passed and to subject every man within the limits of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to conscription.--As it is very certain that there are some who cannot serve from physical disability, and that the soldiers will want bread, meat, and clothing, <persName n="Miles,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Miles,nomatch:0" authname="miles"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Miles</surname></persName> proposes that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, or persons appointed by him, shall have the sole power of determining who is to serve, and who is to be excused.--Now, as the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> is the officer of the <rs>President</rs>, and can be removed at pleasure, to bestow this enormous power on him is to bestow it on the <rs>President</rs>, already rendered almost omnipotent by the repeal of the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> act. We suppose, if the bill should become a law, not less than <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4000">four thousand</num> persons would be found necessary to carry out its provisions, and the power and patronage, bribery and corruption, thereby created, would exceed imagination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285" />The subject was handled with consummate power the other day in the <rs type="place">House</rs> by <persName n="Staples,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Staples,nomatch:0" authname="staples"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Staples</surname></persName>, who made it plainly appear that there was no need of any such law.--"The great abuses of the times," said he, "grow not out of the exemption act, but <hi rend="italics">out of the system of details </hi> allowed by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286" />Here is the mischief, and here the remedy should be applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287" />It is this that is destroying the vitality of the army and the energy of the struggle." He dwelt at length upon this point, and said that if the detailed men were put in the ranks, the stragglers brought back, and the exemption law modified in some particulars, we should have an army capable of coping with the enemy.--He thought the whole subject of conscription and exemption belonged to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288" />It is, he said, a legislative power, a legislative discretion, and a legislative obligation.
