"The officers of several companies," says the <hi rend="italics">Commercial,</hi> "though generally doubting the legality of such claims, are disposed to meet them on the ground of patriotism and honor.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425" /> This is a new expedient to alarm the <rs>South</rs> and intimidate resistance.

Even a submissionist will not get his money on his insurance "unless acting strictly on the defensive!" </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427" /> But this is not the worst of the proclamation of these corporations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428" />The <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Commercial Advertiser" type="newspaper">Commercial Advertiser</orgName></hi> says: "<hi rend="italics">The insurance on slaves would seem to be forfeited in any event;</hi>" for in the utter chaos that would overwhelm the <rs>Southern States</rs> in the event of a civil contest, no claim for <rs n="life insurance" type="product">life insurance</rs> upon such policies could probably be collected." </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433" />If they are, it will be by open and unadulterated robbery. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435" />We are clearly of opinion that every company endorsing this article of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Commercial Advertiser" type="newspaper">Commercial Advertiser</orgName></hi> should be allowed to have neither office nor agent in any Southern State.

The whole Assembly were convulsed with laughter, and the debate terminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460" />At that time was published in <placeName reg="Paris, Bourbon, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040685" authname="tgn,2040685">Paris</placeName>, by <hi rend="smallcaps">Peltier,</hi> subsequently so well known as the libeller of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00266" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0" authname="napoleon"><surname full="yes">Napoleon</surname></persName>,</hi> a furious Royalist journal, styled "<hi rend="italics">The Acts of the <name>Apostles</name>.</hi>" ("<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">Les Actes des Apotres.</hi></foreign>") The Apostles were, of course, the <name>Revolutionary</name> leaders, (Apostles of Liberty,) and their acts were the subject of <hi rend="smallcaps">Peltier's</hi> unceasing ridicule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462" />The revolution had not then attained its full height, and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Guillotin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="mostcommon:Guillotin,nomatch:0" authname="guillotin"><surname full="yes">Guillotin</surname></persName></hi> had not the most distant conception of the uses to which such an instrument would be put, or the immense waste of blood it would occasion, by increasing the facility of shedding it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464" />The propositions of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Guillotin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00271" reg="mostcommon:Guillotin,nomatch:0" authname="guillotin"><surname full="yes">Guillotin</surname></persName>,</hi> indeed, seem to have met with little favor, although several times afterwards debated, and, indeed, when the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <dateStruct value="1791--" full="yes" authname="1791"><year reg="1791" full="yes">1791</year></dateStruct> was under debate, it was proposed to abolish capital punishment altogether, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robespierre</hi> himself being a warm advocate of the proposition. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466" />He seems to have taken into consideration the increased and increasing number of victims; for, in his memorial on the subject, he objects to the use of the sword, because a single execution would so gap it, and blunt its edge, that it would be necessary to grind it before it could be used again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467" />Consequently, where the victims were numerous, it would be necessary to have a large number of swords, and each sword cost something like <num value="600">600</num> livres — that is, <measure n="120dollars" type="currency">$120</measure>. On the score of economy, then, he thought the sword out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468" />But there were other serious objections to it, which he urged with becoming zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469" />Where there are a number of criminals, the blood will frighten those whose turn is to come — the patient will struggle and the execution will become a massacre — the bystanders will be moved to indignation, and vent their wrath on the executioner — the man cannot or will not keep himself in a convenient posture, and thus, instead of shortening his agonies, they will be prolonged by false blows, &amp;c. Some means, therefore, must be devised for <hi rend="italics">fixing</hi> the sufferer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470" />At this time, <date value="1792-03" authname="1792-03">(March, 1792,)</date> there seems to have been no idea of a <hi rend="italics">machine,</hi> notwithstanding the hint of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Guillotin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00274" reg="mostcommon:Guillotin,nomatch:0" authname="guillotin"><surname full="yes">Guillotin</surname></persName>.</hi> The Minister of Justice, however, referred the matter to the <name>Assembly</name>, who appointed a committee to inquire into the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472" />The report was immediately adopted by the <name>Assembly</name>, <date value="1792-03-20" authname="1792-03-20">20th March, 1792.</date> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473" /> In his report, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Louis,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00276" reg="default:Louis,M.,,," authname="louis,m."><foreName full="yes">M.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Louis</surname></persName></hi> says that the mode which he proposes is prevalent in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> — that the body of the criminal is laid on his stomach between <num value="2">two</num> posts connected at the top by a cross-beam, whence a convex hatchet is made to fall suddenly on the patient by the removal of a peg — and that the back of the hatchet should be strong and heavy enough to perform the object like the weight with which piles are driven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474" />He recommends fixing the neck of the patient in a semi-circle, just where the neck joins the hinder bone of the skull — the extremities of the semi-circle to be fastened to the solid parts of the scaffold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475" />It is difficult to say whence <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Louis,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00277" reg="default:Louis,M.,,," authname="louis,m."><foreName full="yes">M.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Louis</surname></persName></hi> derived the notion that this was the common method of inflicting capital punishment in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>; but there seems to be little doubt that he had read a description of the <rs>Halifax Gibbet</rs>, which was the exact prototype of the <name>Guillotine</name>, but which had not been used for more than <measure n="150years" type="date">one hundred and fifty years</measure> before the time under consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477" />Such, however, was not the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478" />At the succeeding election he was left out, and although, when the plan of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Louis,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00280" reg="default:Louis,M.,,," authname="louis,m."><foreName full="yes">M.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Louis</surname></persName></hi> was under consideration, the chief law officer, <hi rend="smallcaps">Roederer,</hi> wrote him a note requesting him to call and give his views, it does not appear that he ever did so, or was ever consulted upon the structure of the machine which was destined to consign him to such a painful immortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479" />He soon sunk into obscurity, which did not prevent him from being arrested and thrown into the concierges, whence, but for the opportune overthrow of <hi rend="smallcaps">Robespierre,</hi> he would have <milestone unit="column" n="3" /> been taken to the scaffold next day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480" />Certain it is, that his object in suggesting a different mode of punishment from that in general use, was purely benevolent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520" />They complained that after these wholesale executions, the blood of the criminals remained in pools, that the dogs came and drank it up, and that crowds of men fed their eyes on the spectacle, which, naturally, had a tendency to harden their hearts, and instigate them to ferocity and bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521" />On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, during a procession of the <rs>Convention</rs>, the cattle which drew the vehicles absolutely refused to pass the blood-saturated spot, and neither blows nor coaxing could overcome their repugnance.
