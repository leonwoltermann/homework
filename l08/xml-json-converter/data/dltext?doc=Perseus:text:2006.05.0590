<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" />The <orgName n="New York World" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">World</hi></orgName> has a long article on <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>'s emancipation proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />It says that he has <q direct="unspecified">"swing loose from the constitutional <unclear> </unclear> of his inaugural address and his messages at the opening of the <num value="2">two</num> successive sessions of Congress under his administration, and is fully adrift on the current of radical fanaticism."</q> From the article we extract the following: </p> <cit><q direct="unspecified"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" /> He has been coerced by the insanity of the radicals, by the denunciation of their presses, by the threats of their Governor and <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> that he should resign, into a proclamation which, on its face, violates the <rs>Constitution</rs>, is contrary to the general current of civilization in the conduct of war as it has run since the <name>Crusades</name>, is in opposition to the solemn declarations made by our Government that this was not to be a war of subjugation, and in manifest obstruction of the re-union of those States for which the nation has fought, and is ready to lavish its blood and treasure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" /> We demand to be informed whence the <rs>President</rs> derives his power to issue any such proclamation as he has now published!. Not from the <rs>Constitution</rs> surely, for it is in plain violation of some of its leading provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />Not from the laws of war, for the laws of war tolerate <unclear /> Not even from the <unclear /> called confiscation act, which the <rs>President</rs> was at <num value="1">one</num> time on the point of vetoing, for the proclamation does not conform to its provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />This proclamation is made in pursuance of that higher law — that is to say, that open defiance of law — which has distinguished the tribe of pestilent abolition agitators from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />Their moral notions are so sublimated and transcendental that they do not recognize the obligation of a compact, or the binding force of an oath, or the authority of a constitutional law duty enacted.--They acknowledge no law but their own unregulated impulses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />Sectional hate, party spirit, political passions inflamed to diabolical fury — these are the "higher-law" of these wretched <unclear /> in comparison with which the sacred obligations of the fundamental law of the land and the public law of nations are as light, in their estimation, as the feathers of a gossamer's wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />In obedience to this higher law of unreasoning passion they undertook, many years ago, to annul <num value="1">one</num> distasteful but minor provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; now they give loose rains to their fanaticism and drive with a coach and <num value="6">six</num> through the very body of the instrument. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />The Constitution confers on the <rs>Federal Government</rs> no power to change the domestic institutions of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />This policy makes changes of the most violent and sweeping character, changes which even the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, in its National Conventions, disclaimed any intention of making and admitted to be unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />The Constitution property of all citizens from forfeitures by civil penalty without trial and conviction; this policy inflicts heavy penalties without even the pretence of a trial — inflicts them on all the citizens of whole States, without even the pretence of any discrimination between the innocent and the guilty, blending them all into <num value="1">one</num> indistinguishable mars without any regard to whether they had <unclear> </unclear> against the <rs>Government</rs> or were non-combatants or whether they had gone into the rebellion voluntarily, of had been coerced into it by the terrorism which has prevailed at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />The Constitution describes the crime of levying war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as treason, and makes certain broad regulations respecting its punishment; but the policy in question assumes to punish levying war in a different way from what the <rs>Constitution</rs> allows it to be punished, by punishing it under some other name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />A men cannot be constitutionally punished as a traitor till he has been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tried; but the policy attempts to circumvent the <rs>Constitution</rs> by inflicting the punishment under some other form than as a penalty of treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />A universal confiscation of the private property of non-combatants, throughout whole States, without trial, without any attempt to distinguish between innocent and guilty, or between the property of full grown male citizens and that of minors and orphans, held by guardians of trustees, is alike contrary to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and to the laws of civilized war, which respect the private property of non-combatants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" /> If we descend from the <rs>Constitution</rs> to the confiscation act, we shall find this extraordinary proclamation indefensible even on the principles of that act. That law does not act on the gross population of areas of country, but on individual persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />The forfeitures it denounces are confined to persons in rebellion against the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />What can be more preposterous, or a more monstrous perversion of justice, then to make the guilt <unclear /> of an <unclear /> depend on whether the <name>States</name> in which he happened to be born shall have representatives in Congress on the <dateStruct value="-01-1" full="yes" authname="--01-01"><day reg="1" full="yes">first</day> day of <month reg="01" full="yes">January</month></dateStruct>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />It would be sufficiently monstrous to make a man's right to his property depend on his own exercise of the elective franchise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />Never was there so degrading a entire on republican institutions as the <unclear /> voting required by <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><roleName n="President" full="yes">President</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />But when a man's property is made to dependant on whether he chooses to vote himself, but on whether his fellow-citizens choose to vote, and whether the number voting under this executive <unclear /> happens to be a majority, we are lost in astonishment that a chief magistrate of a tree country should undertake to make citizens perform what ought to be their freest act under coercing, and to convert the ballot box into a criminal tribunal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />What has the number of votes cast in a criminal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />What has the number of votes cast in a particular election to do with the question whether a particular citizen is guilty of treason?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />Why should women, minors, and orphans, be deprived of their property in consequence of the neglect of citizens to vote. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" /> This extraordinary proclamation will bring no advantages to the negro race at all proportionate of the obstructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />It throws in the way of reunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" />It is certain that the <rs>Union</rs> will never be restored till this ill advised action of the <rs>Government</rs> <unclear />. It converts every inhabitant of the <rs>South</rs> into a zealot whose all is embarked in the success of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />The idea that they will <unclear /> to threats, that they will vote on compulsion that they will feel terror or misgivings, or anything but increased indignation, at such a proclamation shows small knowledge either of human nature or of the temper of the <rs>Southern</rs> mind.--Such a proclamation cannot possibly be enforced, and its only effect will be to strengthen the determination of the rebels to fight to the very last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />They are shut up to a lane which has no turning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />When the military power of the rebels is broken we have laid before ourselves a still harder task to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />At the very crisis of the contest of arms the <rs>President</rs> has reinforced them as effectually as if he had doubled their squadrons in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />We may learn from our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />They will rejoice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />Their leaders will make of this proclamation their chiefest moral weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />It is powerless in our hands for good in theirs, it will be potent for evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />Our only <unclear> vation</unclear> now is in the ballot box. To that it yet remains possible for the people to resort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />There the battle lost to-day may be won to- morrow — there alone the insulted majesty of the <rs>Constitution</rs> may be vindicated by the people against its faithless custodians. </p> </q></cit> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193" />This sage has the advantage, in <num value="1">one</num> respect, over his illustrious predecessor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195" />He is both soldier and theologian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198" />He is skillful not only in comforting the soul, but in divorcing it from the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199" />He has proved, beyond all question, that the <rs>Yankees</rs> have never been defeated on any occasion since this war began; but that, on the contrary, they have always been victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200" />This announcement seems strange, but it must be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201" />A doctor of divinity says so, and doctors of divinity cannot lie. A graduate of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999" authname="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> says so, and students of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999" authname="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> know all about war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203" />There they ran farther than soldiers ever were known to run before, and faster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204" />They threw away everything they had about them — arms, cartridge-boxes, knapsacks, haversacks, blankets, hats, and sometimes even shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205" />They left everything they could not carry on their persons behind them, such as cannon, baggage wagons, horses, military and medical stores, &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206" />To a man who has been in the habit of trusting to his senses, this looks very much like defeat; but the doctor evidently does not think the senses ought to be trusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207" />According to his theory, <q direct="unspecified">"seeing is not believing." </q> When, therefore, we saw <measure n="12000" type="prisoners">12,000 prisoners</measure>, <num value="51">51</num> guns, and <num value="47000">47,000</num> stand of arms brought to this city, we saw the best evidence in the world that the <rs>Yankees</rs> had been victorious, except that afforded by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,," authname="mcclellan,george,b."><surname full="yes">McClellan</surname></persName>'s retreat from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> without ever having taken it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209" />But we stand rebuked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210" />The <rs>Yankees</rs> gained the victory. --The doctor of war and divinity says so. The doctor himself will admit, however, that it will take some time to conquer the country by victories like these. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211" /> A late periodical writer (in the <name>Edinburgh</name> <hi rend="italics">Review,</hi>) says that he who overthrows a great military reputation renders an essential service to mankind.
