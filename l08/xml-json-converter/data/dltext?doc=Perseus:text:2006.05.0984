<head>Another movement of the enemy from the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9" /> Early yesterday morning intelligence reached the city that the enemy, in considerable force, had reached Bottom's bridge, with the supposed intention of another advance upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" />As a matter of consequence, considerable excitement resulted, and rumors were abundant and conflicting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />Many believed that the demonstration was made by Beast <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Butler,B.,F.,,:1" authname="butler,b.,f."><surname full="yes">Butler</surname></persName>, with the earnest determination of rescuing the <rs>Yankee</rs> prisoners now in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, whilst others properly conjectured that it was a feint to divert attention from other, and, at present, more important points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />During the day we endeavored to ascertain something reliable with regard to this new movement, and the result of our efforts, as obtained from the best reliable sources of information, disclosed the following facts: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" /> On <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, our pockets below <placeName reg="Bottom's Bridge">Bottom's Bridge</placeName> discovered that the enemy were advancing in some force — both cavalry and infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />The pickets retired before them until the bridge was crossed, when a stand was made, and the farther advance of the enemy awaited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />In the meantime a supporting force had been sent down to the bridge, and preparations were at once made to dispute its passage by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />At day light yesterday morning the anticipated attempt to cross the bridge was made, but easily repulsed, when they formed a line of battle, and it was readily supposed that they intended to make another effort to cross the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, but finding our men resolution their purpose of maintaining their ground, after remaining in line of battle for an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, the <rs>Yankees</rs> retired, whether to give up the struggle altogether, or to await further reinforcements, is not known. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" /> The announcement of the approach of the enemy induced the requisite preparation upon the part of the authorities here to insure them a proper reception, and hundreds of our citizens girded on their armors to go out and resist the advance of the invaders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" /> <hi rend="italics">Whilst attention</hi> was directed to this quarter, a report obtained currency that the enemy were making a movement on the <rs>Rapidan</rs> and that they had crossed that river in considerable force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />This report, though not together without foundation, was greatly enumerated as to the magnitude of the movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />We learn that the enemy did yesterday morning cross the <rs>Rapidan</rs> in force sufficient to compel the retirement of our pickets, but without making any formidable demonstration withdrew before night to the north bank of the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" /> Last night matters in the city had settled down and things had again resumed their usual quiet. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213" />This was dented, and a peremptory demand was made for a surrender within <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>. The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> reply of <persName n="Lee,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,," authname="lee,r.,e."><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Capt.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName> was, that he would not surrender, and that if the rebel commander wanted him, he would have to come and take him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216" />The position becoming untenable, the howitzer was rolled into the stream, and the men then followed along its line to reach the protection of the gunboat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217" />They were followed by nearly a regiment of rebel infantry and cavalry, which harassed them in their flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218" />A stand was then made opposite the <rs>Smith Briggs</rs>, and a desperate engagement continued until our men were completely overpowered by the superior numbers of the enemy, which was continually augmented by the arrivals of reinforcements. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219" /> Whilst fighting so bravely, our men were shot down without the least mercy being shown them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220" />This these brave, patriotic men seemed to prefer rather than surrender to the rebel foe. All this time the gunboat kept up a constant fire, but so great were the numbers that had to be contended with that at last our men had to give up fighting and take to the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221" />To reach it, however, the poor fellows had to swim from the shore to where she lay in the stream, and in doing this many yielded up their lives to the merciless foe, who shot them as they were really drowning. </p>
