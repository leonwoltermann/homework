<milestone unit="sentence" n="163" /> Each turret contains <num value="2">two</num> guns, and from the peculiar facility which it has for giving direction to the heaviest ordnance, no doubt arises the desire to make these of the heaviest description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164" />How far other considerations should control the character of the ordnance, is necessarily an unsettled question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165" /> To strike an armored ship, it may be best to use a gun capable of the greatest power; but whether this shall be derived from a projectile of great weight, driven by low velocity, or of less weight and high velocity; whether it shall be a <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15-inch</measure> gun, fired with <num value="35">thirty five</num> or <measure n="40l." type="pounds"><num value="40">forty</num> pounds</measure>, or a <measure n="13inch" type="distance">13 inch</measure>, fired with <measure n="50l." type="pounds"><num value="50">fifty</num> pounds</measure> of powder, is not here material; the weight of the gun for either purpose will not vary to any important degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166" />But in operations against earthworks, whose material cannot be damaged permanently, but only disturbed, and which are only to be dealt with by keeping down their fire, a much lighter projectile would be preferable, in order that the practice may be as rapid as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167" />Hence a piece of <measure n="16000pounds" type="mass">16,000 lbs</measure> for <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10 inch</measure> or <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11 inch</measure> shot and shell. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168" /> When a number of monitors are brought together, it would be better also to have guns of like kind in each turret, and bringing into action which ever might be preferable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169" /> Each of the monitors of this squadron had a <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15 inch</measure> and a smaller gun, <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11 inch</measure> or <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8 inch</measure> rifle, and hence the rapidity of fire which was most desirable was not attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170" />That this was due to the calibre of the gun, and not to its being located in a turret may be shown by <num value="1">one</num> notable instance. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179" /> Thus it is to be presumed that there will be equality of advance power in the same number of <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11 inch</measure> guns as to the rapidity of fire whether in a turret or broadside. </p> </div4>

<div4 type="entry" n="6" org="uniform" sample="complete"> 
<head>The Ironsides.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187" />The Ironsides is a fine powerful ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188" />Her armor has stood heavy battering very well, and her broadside of <num value="7">seven</num> <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11-inch</measure> guns, and <num value="1">one</num> <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8-inch</measure> rifle has always told with signal effect when opened on the enemy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190" />The defects of the vessel are the unplated ends, which are consequently easily damaged by a raking fire, and involve the rudder and screw more or less, while she can return no fire in either direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191" />This was particularly and frequently inconvenient in attacking the works on <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074" authname="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>, for at certain stages of the tide vessels tall nearly across the channel, and present bow and stern to the beach of <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074" authname="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192" />So that sometimes it was necessary to delay placing the vessels in position, and at others she would swing around very awkwardly when engaged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193" />The monitors, on the other hand, were almost equally well defended on all sides, and could fire in any direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194" />The Ironsides was also open to descending shot, and her scope of fire too much restricted by badly placed ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195" />The desire for comparison which rages just now can easily be satisfied by bringing the above data in juxtaposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196" />Just as they are, the <rs>Ironsides</rs> is capable of a more rapid and concentrated fire, which, under the circumstances, make her guns more effective than the <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15 inch</measure> of the monitors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197" /> On the other hand, she was restricted by draft to the mid-channel, was very vulnerable to the raking fire, and the direction of her own guns was very limited interally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198" />The monitors could operate in most of the channels, could direct their fire around the whole circle, and were almost equally well defended on all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199" />The defects in both classes of vessels are susceptible of being remedied partially or entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200" />The defence of the <rs>Ironsides</rs> could be made complete, and that of the monitors equally so. The armament of the monitors equally could be perfected so as to give all desirable rapidity of fire, but by no contrivance could the <rs>Ironsides</rs> be enabled to use much heavier guns than those mounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201" />Yet when such changes were made as experience suggested, there still would remain to the monitors the lighter draft, choice of guns from the heaviest to the lightest, defensibility, and direction of fire around the whole circle; consequently the ability to carry a heavier battery into the least depth of water, with equal power of offence and defence in any direction, and that with half the number of guns carried in broadside by another vessel. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202" /> The comparison now made is to be understood as having relation to existing circumstances, and not at all intended as conclusive in regard to the general merits of iron-clads. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203" /> It is in this sense that the action of the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> is to be considered with reference to the selection of <num value="1">one</num> class of vessels over another. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204" /> It is evident that it was not designed to adopt any <num value="1">one</num> style exclusively, for of the <num value="3">three</num> vessels <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ordered, <num value="2">two</num> were of the ordinary broadside class — the <rs>Ironsides</rs> and the <rs>Galena</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205" />The latter was quickly proved to be absolutely inefficient, and so must any armored steamer of that size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206" />It is universally admitted that plates of less than <num value="4.5">four and a half</num> (<num value="4.5">4 ½</num>) inches cannot stand the shock of heavy projectiles, and vessels so armored must be of considerable tonnage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207" />I presume the <name>Department</name> only intended to build such vessels as were best adapted to the service at the scene of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208" /> Keeping in view the peculiar exigencies of the case, which required light draft and great ordnance power, it appears that the selection of the <name>Department</name> could not have been more judicious in preferring a number of monitors to operate from a heavy frigate as a base; and of the intent of the <name>Department</name> could have been carried out in regard to numbers, we should now have been in entire possession of the coast from the <name>Capes</name> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to New Orleans, including <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631" authname="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582" authname="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444" authname="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, &amp;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209" /> Many detects of both classes are easily remediable, but some of those in the monitors could only be determined by the lost of battle; before that, approximation only was possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210" /> What other style of vessel could the <name>Department</name> have chosen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211" />Certainly none that has been built by <name>English</name> or <name>French</name> naval authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212" />The Warrior and her class are exceedingly powerful, but could not get within gunshot here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213" />On the other hand, there is very little navigable water on the coast which is not accessible to the monitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214" />They command supremely all that is near the shore, and cannot themselves be reached by vessels of heavier draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215" />So that when there was some reason to apprehend the appearance of certain rams in this quarter, I assured the <name>Department</name> that the iron-clads could maintain position so long as coal and provisions lasted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216" /> It may appear that I speak too positively on the subject, but some experience with them certainly gives a right to do so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217" /> With a single exception, I have been on board a monitor in all the principal actions, and the recurrence of casualties to the <rs type="role" reg="Fleet-Captain">Fleet Captains</rs> near me shows that I was in a situation to judge.

<head>A contrast.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345" /> The contrast between <name>Yankee</name> parade, sensationalism, bluster, and bragging, and the conservative sentiment, sincerity, and freedom from all affectation and bluster, of the <rs>Southern</rs> character, may be very happily illustrated by the customs of the press of the <num value="2">two</num> peoples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346" />Had the <rs>Yankees</rs> had <num value="1">one</num> tithe of the military success that has crowned the <rs>Confederate</rs> arms within a few weeks, not a day would have passed that the huge dailies of the principal Northern cities would not have had columns of jubilation and boastful accounts introduced by flaming displays of capitals of all sorts, forming captions sometimes as long as the narratives they introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347" />Here the most signal victories are announced plainly and truthfully, without parade or balderdash — just as they should be to a sensible, sincere, and intelligent people, who are not to be misled or unduly excited by flaming and bombastic announcements, and by exaggerated and boastful narratives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348" />The presses cater for entirely different people, and therefore their styles are entirely different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349" />It is due to the press to say that the style here entirely accords with the spirit of its conductors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350" />If the people wanted a different kind of press, a different set of conductors would be found no doubt to meet their wishes, but neither the people nor the editors desire anything else. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351" /> Another marked distinction between the papers of the <num value="2">two</num> countries is the uniform frankness and truthfulness of the <rs>Southern</rs> press, with regard to defeats of our arms and to facts even painful; such as those of the currency, the supplies and, indeed, every other public matter, painful or otherwise.
