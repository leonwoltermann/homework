<milestone unit="sentence" n="65" />The country was somewhat startled by the rumor, followed by the acknowledged statement, that <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0" authname="rosecrans"><surname full="yes">Rosecrans</surname></persName> had been relieved from his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66" />The reasons seem to be that he exceeded his instructions and was unsuccessful; that he aimed to take <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331" authname="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, when he should have been content with <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496" authname="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and that when he met the enemy the battle was not as skillfully managed as it might have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72" />The more correct understanding of the causes that led to it is that charges were preferred against him by <persName n="McCook,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:McCook,nomatch:0" authname="mccook"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Generals</roleName> <surname full="yes">McCook</surname></persName> and <persName n="Crittenden,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0" authname="crittenden"><roleName n="General" full="yes" /><surname full="yes">Crittenden</surname></persName> of unofficer like conduct on the battle-field, of a panic- stricken flight from the field to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496" authname="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, while the battle was in its crisis, and of his unsoldierly and mischievous conduct in publicly reporting, on reaching <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496" authname="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, to both officers and men that the day was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73" />Superadded to this is alleged Governmental resentment of his disobedience of positive orders not to risk a general engagement by advancing beyond <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496" authname="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> before he was reinforced; also, its impatience of his disposition and handling his troops on the field. </p> </q></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74" />The reputation for courage that he won at <placeName reg="Stones River, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2696868" authname="tgn,2696868">Stone river</placeName> is plead in bar to the imputation of cowardice in his abandonment of the battle-ground, and his friends attribute it to a mistaken impression that his army had been wholly whipped and was wholly on the retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75" />The replication to this is that such a mistake is a complete disqualification for command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76" />The statement acquiring growth that he had an attack of epilepsy during the battle, and that he was subject to that disease, is untrue; but that he was constitutionally and by education subject to fits of religious depression of the profoundest character, is correct, as is well known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77" />In connection with this it may not be unsuitable to add that it is understood that the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> specification of the preferred charge is an excessive use of opium. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78" />The relations between <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0" authname="rosecrans"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Rosecrans</surname></persName> and the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs>, <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0" authname="halleck"><surname full="yes">Halleck</surname></persName>, have been bad.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197" /> Certain inconveniences are very likely to flow from the decision; nor is it to be expected that the troublous relations of neutrals to belligerents, even when they are kept on their most precise and sound footing, should be entirely free from embarrassment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198" />We may, for instance, apprehend that some among the <rs>Federals</rs> will regard the proceeding as dictated by the threats which have been levelled at this country — unofficially, no doubt, for we have admitted that the tenor of the communication from <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,," authname="washington,george"><surname full="yes">Washington</surname></persName> occasioned no just ground for complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199" />But the public of the <rs>Northern States</rs> is likely enough to ascribe the "concession" to a judicious reverence for American power and daring; and it would not at all surprise us if the event were associated <hi rend="italics">with certain unprecedented phenomena of the <rs>Russian</rs> navy at New York.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200" /> That the necessity or expediency of the seizure was not self-evident, is apparent from the time bestowed on the inquiry into the facts; and it also shows clearly enough how deeply impressed was. <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Ministers with the paramount importance of keeping the duties, and, therefore, the correlative rights of neutrals clear from any new ambiguity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201" />Independently of abiding considerations which would suggest that zealous caution — the lively interest of this country in securing the greatest distinctness and the most general observance of maritime law — the present condition of the world forces the whole class of subjects upon our attention with peculiar emphasis. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202" /> It is impossible to assert that we may not, at a very early date, have to appeal to the guarantees and immunities of the international code; and ill would that Minister serve his Sovereign or his country who should, in view of these very contingencies, provide a case to be thrown in our teeth on the next occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207" />So far as the facts of the present case have been, not known, but surmised, it might have been conjectured that <persName n="Laird,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Laird,nomatch:0" authname="laird"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Messrs.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Laird</surname></persName> had every ground for free trade in their business; and we are well aware that certain of the very ablest legists in this country — possibly we might venture to guess that even some who were in a yet more responsible position — at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inclined to the opinion that the international code would afford neither the requirement nor the warrant to arrest the departure of the vessels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208" /> At the same time, all who are familiar with the special branch of study, even in its accidence, must be aware no persons, subjects of a neutral Power, are at liberty to accept a direct commission from a belligerent to construct and equip war ships for use in hostilities against an ally of that neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209" />The practical question in the present case, therefore, was not whether shipbuilders at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2463110" authname="tgn,2463110">Liverpool</placeName>, or any other port, may or may not construct vessels, though they should ultimately sail under the flag of the belligerent — for on that point we have no doubt — but whether the shipbuilders specifically named had, avowedly or ascertainable, accepted the orders of the belligerents through <persName n="Iris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:Iris,nomatch:0" authname="iris"><surname full="yes">Iris</surname></persName> agents; and if so, whether the mode of proceeding was such as to render the <rs>British</rs> subjects amenable to the charge of infringing the law of neutrals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210" /> In that event, of course, the <rs>Government</rs> of those <name>British</name> subjects must hold itself responsible for the due enforcement of the law. It is not for us to criticise the sagacity or the discretion of commercial gentlemen who should turn out to be so much at fault in the comprehension of their own liabilities; nor need we spend <num value="1">one</num> moment in asking by what lack of discretion or invention they stumbled into so false a position.
