<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59" />The presidents of the railroads in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> have prepared a statement relative to the expenses of conducting them at war prices, in which we find some valuable statistics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60" />In the matter of wages paid to their employees, it appears that an average advance of <num value="8">eight hundred per cent.</num> on peace rates has been found necessary, except in negro hire, which has been advanced about <num value="4">four hundred per cent.</num> In other expenses, the advance has been much greater; and, in addition to this, the great scarcity of labor, the high price of oils, tallow, etc., and the daily deterioration of the machinery, has to be contended with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61" />In the depreciation of their property from these and similar causes, <num value="1">one</num> of the principal companies of the <rs>State</rs> estimate their annual loss at <measure n="700000dollars" type="currency">$700,000</measure>, and in this do not include the losses of bridges, machinery and roadway, caused by the contending armies, which is over <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">$1,000,000</measure>. Notwithstanding this fact, the tolls are only <num value="10">ten</num> times, and the fares only <num value="5">five</num> times, what they were before the war. Reducing the fare to an article of indispensable necessity to railroad companies, it is shown that where a passenger who paid <measure n="4dollars" type="currency">four dollars</measure> before the war and <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> now, might now pay his fare for <measure n="2l." type="pounds"><num value="2">two</num> pounds</measure> of tallow (or its value in money.) In the matter of the surplus revenues and the large dividends declared, this pamphlet says that it is from the impossibility of expending this surplus in making proper repairs to the roads and stock — the material for repairs not being in the country — and that all this must inevitably be met by the stockholders at some future day. The presidents, in <milestone unit="column" n="4" /> view of these facts, deprecate hostile legislation, State or Confederate, and say: </p> <cit><q rend="break" direct="unspecified"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62" /> "From these facts, it follows that unless our railroads are sustained by enlightened and liberal legislation and action of our public authorities, State and Confederate, instead of being made, without defence or advocacy, the object of constant and blind denunciation and of <hi rend="italics">hostile class legislation,</hi> they <hi rend="italics">inevitably must be broken down,</hi> and be lost to the country and <hi rend="italics">to our military operations, </hi> for all history and experience proves that their attempted maintenance and operation by <hi rend="italics">Government</hi> officials will inevitably only hasten, with greatly increased expense, their final ruin.
