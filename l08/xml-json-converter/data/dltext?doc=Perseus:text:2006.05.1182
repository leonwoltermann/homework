<milestone unit="sentence" n="123" />And all these bright deeds of arms were performed by men who had to be taught to ride <hi rend="italics">after they were <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> of age, and upon horses that had been broken by riding-masters who themselves would not have dared to mount a wild young horse, as our cavalrists do.</hi>" </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133" />The actual shock of cavalry combat, where force meets force in the headlong charge, is utterly unknown to our system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134" />The so-called cavalry dismount, dig a ditch, or get behind trees and pop away at each other after he fashion of <name>Indian</name> fighters in the impenetrable forests of the far <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146" />There never was such a body of troops as the <rs>Queen</rs>'s Rangers, under <persName n="Simcoe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Simcoe,nomatch:0" authname="simcoe"><surname full="yes">Simcoe</surname></persName>. --<orgName n="Legion"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,," authname="lee,r.,e."><surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName>'s Legion</orgName> was the fabrication of some crazy rebel during the revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149" />These are all inventions — pure inventions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150" />The country would not have admitted any of these things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151" />It was infinitely more wooded then than it is now. Of course it could not have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152" />When we read, therefore, that Tariton charged the disordered ranks of <persName n="Gates,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Gates,nomatch:0" authname="gates"><surname full="yes">Gates</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Camden, Kershaw, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095449" authname="tgn,2095449">Camden</placeName>, and produced an irrepressible stampede, and that he pursued the fugitives for miles upon miles, cutting them down by the dozen at every step, we are reading of something altogether imaginary — something existing only in the heated fancies of the writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153" />The men who came from the <name>Waxhaw</name> settlements to a certain court-house, not many miles from this city, and there exhibited the terrible wounds that Tariton's men had inflicted in charging them, lied of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154" />The face of the country was very woody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155" />How could Tariton charge there? </p> </q></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156" /> We believe the excuse about the nature of the country to be utterly unfounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157" />An author whom we have quoted before--<persName n="Schaller,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="mostcommon:Schaller,nomatch:0" authname="schaller"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Colonel</roleName> <surname full="yes">Schaller</surname></persName>--pronounces it to be so in the following words: <q direct="unspecified">"No instances of what cavalry can do are necessary; history furnishes <num value="1000">thousands</num> of them; and if <num value="1">one</num> would contend that the nature of the ground with us is such as to forbid anything like a charge or effective pursuit, he but shows ignorance of the topography of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe," authname="tgn,1000003">European</placeName> battle-fields!"</q> There it is, the whole truth, we doubt not. To tell us at this time of day that cavalry cannot charge and pursue in the countries where Tariton and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> charged and pursued <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> ago is preposterous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158" /> Our men want nothing more than to be taught the use of the sabre, and the practice of charging with that weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159" />Among the mounted men let there be a portion, at least, of these; and they the best riders, on the best horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160" />Do not make mounted infantry of <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the cavalry force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161" />Let every squadron have a certain number of mounted infantry, say <num value="40">forty</num>, as <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00121" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0" authname="marmont"><surname full="yes">Marmont</surname></persName> advises in his book, which <persName n="Schaller,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Schaller,nomatch:0" authname="schaller"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Colonel</roleName> <surname full="yes">Schaller</surname></persName> has translated expressly for the use of our army, and which has the seal of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00123" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0" authname="davis"><roleName n="President" full="yes">President</roleName> <surname full="yes">Davis</surname></persName>'s approbation, and, we understand, of most other military men. Let the cavalry be made cavalry sure enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162" />We have very good officers; such as <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00124" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0" authname="hampton"><surname full="yes">Hampton</surname></persName>, <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0" authname="forrest"><surname full="yes">Forrest</surname></persName>, <persName n="Fitz,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="mostcommon:Fitz,nomatch:0" authname="fitz"><surname full="yes">Fitz</surname></persName>, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,," authname="lee,r.,e."><surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Wickham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Wickham,nomatch:0" authname="wickham"><surname full="yes">Wickham</surname></persName>, &amp;c. Let them be instructed to teach their men the use of the sabre, or to have it taught, and the evolutions necessary for cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163" />Then, when we inflict another defeat on the enemy, there may be some hope of throwing a body of cavalry upon his disordered forces and gaining a decisive victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164" />Then we shall have no more long, murderous, indecisive battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165" />Then there will be bodies of troops who both can and will protect the country from pillage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166" />The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of our commanders who shall teach his men to trust to the <hi rend="italics">spur</hi> for victory will find himself suddenly occupying a niche in the temple of fame alongside of Siedlitz and <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0" authname="murat"><surname full="yes">Murat</surname></persName>. </p> </div3>
