<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188" /> There is some reason to suppose that these percentages of <persName n="Fry,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="mostcommon:Fry,nomatch:0" authname="fry"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Col.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Fry</surname></persName>'s are stated loosely in favor of the "draft" They show an aggregate result to the <rs>Federal</rs> army of <num value="72000">72,000</num>, whereas <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0" authname="halleck"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Halleck</surname></persName> sets it down in his official report at about <measure n="50000dollars" type="currency">$50,000</measure>. <persName n="Fry,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Fry,nomatch:0" authname="fry"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Col.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Fry</surname></persName> himself says that the expenses of the conscription, which he states to have been <measure n="1200000dollars" type="currency">$1,200,000</measure>, is about <num value="1">one</num> <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> that of the payments made for "commutation." At <unclear><measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure></unclear> in each instance, even taking that proportion fully, his own statement would thus reduce the <num value="72000">72,000</num> resulting from his percentage in the case to about <num value="40000">40,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189" />The figures in the above table may therefore be held considerably in excess of the actual results of the "draft. " The conscription had not, I appears, been carried out in all the <name>States</name>; but only a few members of "the <rs>Union</rs>" having been omitted in a measure pressed so searchingly, the shortcomings on this account may in all likelihood be held covered by the excess of the forgoing figures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190" /> <num value="300000">Three hundred thousand</num> men having been sought for, <persName n="Fry,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Fry,nomatch:0" authname="fry"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Col.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Fry</surname></persName> admits that he obtained but <num value="72000">72,000</num>. --This general fact shows that the last draft was a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191" />The average which I struck in <num value="22">number 22</num> of these dispatches will have shown, on the faith of the returns in <num value="8">eight</num> districts of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517" authname="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, that the breadth of the conscription covered <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the whole material available at the <rs>North</rs> for recruitment of her armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192" /><num value="1300000">1,300,000</num> of the flower of her manhood having been already brought into the field, this exhaustion of her resources in men available for military service is not to be wondered at even though considerations of industrial production had not already come in to establish the fact more forcibly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193" />Assuming, however, that the draft now spoken of by <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>'s agents be carried out to the fullest extent, the experience of last year's conscription shows that it will not yield over <num value="144000">144,000</num> men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194" /> Industrial considerations appear to forbid the extension of the conscription now proposed to all the manhood fit for military duty within "the <rs>Union</rs>." The deficit in last year's crop of wheat at the <rs>North</rs> amounted, it appears, to the enormous quantity of <num value="16000000">16,000,000</num> of bushels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195" />The resources for substitution may, no withstanding the infamous measures that have been employed for stimulating the emigration of able-bodied Germans and Irishmen, be fairly supposed to have been already largely absorbed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196" /> This fact will increase desertion, and tend further to reduce the actual results of the "draft" by throwing many cases that take place under the head of "substitutions," in the present returns of <persName n="Fry,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00131" reg="mostcommon:Fry,nomatch:0" authname="fry"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Col.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Fry</surname></persName>, under the head of "commutations."--The fact that <num value="90000">90,000</num> men succeeded in cheating the last conscription of victims by refusing to "report," shows a state of public opinion which, in a thinly settled country, with mountains, forests, and swamps, offers quite as safe a means as commutation or substitution for slipping through the meshes of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>'s net. Reasonable expectation, therefore, may look in the coming "draft" for a large addition to the percentage of the last under the head of those who declined to "report. " Assuming the extension of the conscription now to all that remain available at the <rs>North</rs> for service in the field, there is, for these reasons, fair grounds for the conclusion that the results of the pending measures for that purpose will fall very far below <num value="114000">114,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197" />But may it not be confidently assumed, with the evidence before us of the fact of upwards of half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of acres of land under <num value="1">one</num> crop having already dropped out of culture, that the proposed "draft" cannot be carried out to any very great extent without overrunning the limit of commissariat necessities — as has already been done in reference to financial exigencies — to the very serious crippling of the resources of labor required for Northern production. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198" /> But <persName n="Fry,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="mostcommon:Fry,nomatch:0" authname="fry"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Col.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Fry</surname></persName>'s figures do not show the working of the "draft" beyond the time when he delivered its victims to <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0" authname="meade"><surname full="yes">Meade</surname></persName>'s or <placeName><persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0" authname="rosecrans"><surname full="yes">Rosecrans</surname></persName>'s office</placeName>rs bound hand and foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199" />My dispatch of the <date value="12-10" authname="12-10">10th of December</date> went into that part of the history of last year's conscription at the point where <persName n="Fry,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:Fry,nomatch:0" authname="fry"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Col.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Fry</surname></persName>'s returns stop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200" />In order to follow out the subject in connection with that officer's figures I will repeat here that those conscripts added nothing whatever to the <rs>Federal</rs> strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201" />They dragged through the forms of drill in a spirit of morose mutiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202" />They sat over their camp fires in sullen groups away from the older soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203" />They regarded the volunteers around them with the hate attaching to the instruments of an obnoxious compulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204" />They were never allowed to go outside the rear camp pickets; and were in fact constantly under surveillance or guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205" />To prevent their desertion in the hour of battle they were placed in its very front.--Of all this there can be no doubt; and the conclusion is therefore irresistible that the conscription of <dateStruct value="1863--" full="yes" authname="1863"><year reg="1863" full="yes">1863</year></dateStruct> added nothing in fact to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>'s strength in the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206" /> The dogged spirit of last years conscripts was, however, not merely passive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207" />It took form, naturally, in desertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346" />We can hardly bring ourselves to believe the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347" />Nevertheless, it is certainly so, monstrous as it may be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348" /> Let us see how the thing will work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349" />A man in <dateStruct value="1860--" full="yes" authname="1860"><year reg="1860" full="yes">1860</year></dateStruct> buys an estate of a <measure n="1000acres" type="area">thousand acres</measure>, at <measure n="15dollars" type="currency">fifteen dollars</measure> an acre, and gives his bond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350" />Secession takes place, and the law prohibiting the collection of debts during present troubles sets him at ease with regard to his payments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351" />In the mean time, he happens to have in his possession <measure n="10barrels" type="mass">ten barrels</measure> of whiskey, which he can sell at <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1,500</measure> a barrel, Confederate money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352" />He sells this whiskey and with the proceeds pays for the estate.--The money which he pays being worth, at present, about <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> in the dollar, he gets the estate for <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure>; that is to say, for half a dollar an acre, whereas he promised to pay <num value="15">fifteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353" />The man who holds the estate has no option.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354" />He must take this money or nothing, for the proposed law makes it a legal tender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355" />Is it possible that a <orgName n="Virginia Senate" type="senate">Virginia Senate</orgName> can mean to encourage such a fraud as this by giving it the sanction of law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356" />Yet this is the inevitable consequence of such a law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357" /> The committee who reported this bill, we have no doubt acted with good intentions.--They believed that they were taking an important step in the right direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358" />They thought that to make the existing currency a legal tender was to arrest the progress of deprecation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359" />The slightest recurrence to examples of world wide notoriety would have convinced them of their mistake.--Congress, itself, about <num value="1">one</num> year ago, passed a law equivalent in its operation to a legal tender law. It taxed, in the hands of the holder, all evidences of indebtedness in payment of which he refused to receive the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency, and that so exorbitantly that in a very few years the tax will consume principal and interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360" />This most iniquitous law has inflicted vast injury on many creditors who had already been debarred the privilege of collecting their debts in the usual way, until after the war, and who certainly are as much entitled to the protection of the <name>Legislature</name> as other classes of persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361" />But has it had the slightest effect in delaying, even for a moment, the downhill march of the <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362" />Look at the actual facts of the ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363" />This time last year the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency was about <num value="7">7</num> or <num value="8">8</num> to <num value="1">one</num>. <measure n="3weeks" type="date">Three weeks</measure> ago it was <num value="20">20</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364" />This day it is <num value="30">30</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, and who can tell what it will be a month hence, if Congress do not arrest it in its precipitate career by stopping <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0" authname="memminger"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Memminger</surname></persName>'s machine, and passing stringent laws to compel the funding of outstanding notes? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365" /> This was not a new question, even when Congress passed this law. It had been thoroughly tested <measure n="170years" type="date">170 years</measure> before in the then colony of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517" authname="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, which issued a number of bills of credit, and after securing, as they thought, their currency at <hi rend="italics">par,</hi> by heavy penalties upon those who refused to take them, proceeded to declare them legal tender by law. A great number of persons were swindled out of their just dues, but the law did not arrest the depreciation for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366" />Every <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Northern</rs> colonies followed the example of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517" authname="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, with exactly the same result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367" /><placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709" authname="tgn,7007709">North</placeName> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712" authname="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> tried it; but, like the <rs>Northern States</rs>, they failed altogether to prevent depreciation by penal laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368" />In <num value="10">ten</num> different instances, therefore, it had been tried in the colonies, when the <name>Revolution</name> had the folly to try it once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369" />And there was the most signal failure of all. The Revolutionary Congress affixed to the refusal to take the continental paper at <hi rend="italics">par</hi> the most frightful penalties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370" />The person so offending was declared to be guilty of treason, was made liable to the punishment of that crime, was declared to be out of the pale of the law. --Yet in a year after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> notes were issued they began to decline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371" />Seeing this, the <rs>Congress</rs> passed a law making them a legal tender, when they declined more rapidly than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372" />They fell to <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="20">twenty</num>, <num value="30">thirty</num>, <num value="50">fifty</num>, <num value="100">one hundred</num>, and a <num value="1000">thousand</num> for <num value="1">one</num>, when they expired without a groan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373" />Let those members of the <name>Senate</name> who desire to vote understandingly on this question, go into the library and get the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume of <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0" authname="jefferson"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Jefferson</surname></persName>'s Memoirs and Correspondence.--They will there see the whole matter exposed, and the reason given for the decline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374" />They will see that the cause was such as could not possibly be reached by making them a legal tender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375" />It was the very same which has made the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency not worth much more than the intrinsic value of the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376" />For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year, when very few bills had been issued, the <rs>Continental</rs> money was at <hi rend="italics">par.</hi> As the necessities of the <rs>State</rs> required, the issues increased, until the currency became so redundant that <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0" authname="jefferson"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Jefferson</surname></persName> says <rs type="color">silver</rs> and <rs type="color">gold</rs>, under the like circumstances, would have depreciated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377" /> The very same system was tried in Revolutionary <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378" />The Convention, when the value of the assignats declined, tried to keep it up by making it legal tender and passing all sorts of sanguinary laws to force its continued circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379" />But they all failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380" />Why, then — when this thing has been so often tried without success — why try it again?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381" />We say nothing of the immense depreciation of morals which is sure to follow such laws, and which, in the case of the colonies, is feelingly lamented by their historians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382" />It is surely not the duty of legislators to tempt the people to act dishonestly, as laws of this character inevitably do. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386" />Yet she never dreamed, during <hi rend="italics">that</hi> interval, of making them a legal tender, for the all sufficient reason that they were <hi rend="italics">not</hi> equal to <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> in value — the very reason that is now prompting our Legislature to a contrary course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387" />At length, in <dateStruct value="1834--" full="yes" authname="1834"><year reg="1834" full="yes">1834</year></dateStruct>, when the notes of the <orgName n="Bank of England" type="bank">Bank of England</orgName> were worth pound for pound and shilling for shilling of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, an act of Parliament <hi rend="italics">did </hi> declare them legal tender, purely as a matter of convenience, and because the receiver could lose nothing by it.
