<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />He wrote innumerable articles to prove that the <rs>South</rs> was altogether in the right — that the <rs>South</rs> was too powerful for the <rs>North</rs>--that the children of the <rs>South</rs> were of a character too martial for the <rs>North</rs> to hope for success in a contest between the <num value="2">two</num> sections — that the <rs>South</rs>, in such a contest, would be able to bring out its entire strength, from the circumstance of its having at home a body of tillers who were fit for nothing else but to till the soil, whereas the <rs>North</rs> could not subtract more than a certain portion of its population from agriculture — that the <rs>South</rs> held in its hands the great maple which commanded the commerce of the world, and which it was impossible to substitute from any quarter — that the <rs>South</rs> had no cause to dread the rivalry of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat" authname="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, as the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> had foolishly asserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />We distrust Northern men with Southern principles wherever we hear of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />But we do not conceive them to be so bad as foreign renegades with no principle at all. We could not see how it could be possible that anything good could proceed from so vile a source, or how a man who had made money out of the stripes inflicted upon his own person, and who had notoriously connived at the dishonor of his own family, could be trusted in any circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />The result has proved that our distrust was justly founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />A mob threatened the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> office with destruction; the tone of the paper was instantly changed; from the warmest of friends it became instantly the bitterest of enemies, and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0" authname="bennett"><surname full="yes">Bennett</surname></persName></hi> never had the grace to assign a single reason for the change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />Of all the base flattery of which old <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName full="yes">Abe</foreName></persName></hi> has been the recipient, there is none so base as that which flows from the columns of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />His soul is the soul of a slave, who kisses the hand that is lifted to scourge him. He eats the words he uttered <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago every day of his life, and he seems to delight in the meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />He is in favor of suppressing all the journals in New York <unclear>t</unclear> think and speak as he thought and spoke before his sudden conversion by the mob. </p>

Up to this time they have succeeded in securing to themselves and to the <rs>State</rs> peace and tranquility as the fruits of the policy they adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608" />My single object now is to promote the continuance of these blessing to the people of this State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609" /> Until within a brief period the people of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255" authname="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> were quiet and tranquil, free from domestic strife, and undisturbed by internal commotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610" />They have resisted no law, rebelled against no authority, engaged in no revolution, but constantly proclaimed their firm determination to pursue their peaceful avocations, earnestly hoping that her own soil would be spared the presence of armed troops, and that the scene of conflict would be kept removed beyond the border of their State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611" />By thus avoiding all occasions for the introduction of bodies of armed soldiers, and offering no provocation for the presence of military force, the people of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255" authname="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> have sincerely striven to preserve in their State domestic peace and avert the calamities of sanguinary engagements. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616" />This movement now imperils that peace and tranquility which, from the beginning of our pending difficulties, have been the paramount desire of this people, and which, up to this time, they have so secured to the <rs>State</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637" />Still can I not construe any of their votes as meaning that they will prosecute a coercive war against their Southern brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638" />They meant only that they have still some hope of the restoration and perpetuation of the <rs>Union</rs>, and until that hope is blasted they will not alter their existing relations.
