<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508" /> A heartless class of individuals, whom the press have appropriately denominated <q direct="unspecified">"the <rs>Army Worm</rs>."</q> are profaning our noble cause with their foul touch. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509" /> The eye of grave disapprobation, it is true, has been levelled at such a practice, with singular unanimity, and yet its vitality is active and vigorous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510" /> With what deep concern do patriot hearts behold such exactions laid upon a gallant soldiery, whose arms are raised in defence of those who impose them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511" />No portion of our embryo republic is entirely free from this plague.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512" />Within the extremely short space of <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure>, it has wound its form not only through the pores of Government and the great city, but its oppressive weight is being felt by the country people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513" />The unprecedented price of <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure> per sack for slat, is realized with frightful discontent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514" />Apprehensions of the future swell to immeasurable proportions.--Nor is this the child of necessity, when the exorbitant price is traced to its primal origin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515" />Far from it. With the limited facilities for manufacturing salt in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, the supply will be unequal to the demand at present.--But with less prodigality than heretofore, and a relief from unprincipled speculators, who raised that article to such high figures by a monopoly of the trade, the people could be supplied at more reasonable rates.--Nor are such extravagant extortions confined to any particular character of trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516" />It is their business to watch for desperate openings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517" />In all haste is each and every opportunity improved; the soldier's pocket is rified, and the public bureau cozened with the same heartless indifference that the farmer's substance is destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518" />To such a shameful extent has this spirit of avarice been encouraged already that it threatens the most disastrous consequences to our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519" />Such a practice cannot be judged otherwise than with the most harsh indignation, No act which comes within the comprehension of the human mind can deservedly call forth anathemas more severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520" />However so much <num value="1">one</num> may presume to justify such a course, its baseness is tripled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521" /> Such a practice is not confined alone to our own country, in its heinous insults, but its influence will stamp an impress upon foreign soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522" />Nor is it prudent that such a dishonorable traffic should be longer sanctioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523" />It is the people's right as much as their duty to purge our country and our army of all such impurities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524" />Desperate times like these call for desperate action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525" />Such a violation of human right and justice can only be effectually checked by the popular voice in its native majesty.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929" /> <hi rend="italics">Auditors Dispatch:</hi>--In a recent number of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch,</hi> in a communication giving an account of the disturbances in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825" authname="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, the number of traitors assembled at their several camps, &amp;c., the writer remarks that <num value="500">five hundred</num> men were expected to join them from <placeName reg="Watanga county">Watanga county</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7007709" n="1.000 4" reg="north carolina" authname="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930" />That statement conveys an imputation upon the patriotism of the people of that county, an unjust and contrary to the facts in the care, that I ask to be permitted to correct it through your columns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931" /> Watanga is a small county lying along the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, giving only about <num value="600">six hundred</num> votes, and although adjoining Last <placeName key="tgn,7007825" n="1.000 7" reg="tennessee" authname="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, has <num value="3">three</num> fail companies in our army — a company of cavalry under <persName n="Folk,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00483" reg="mostcommon:Folk,nomatch:0" authname="folk"><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Capt.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Folk</surname></persName>, and <num value="2">two</num> companies of infantry under <persName n="Horton,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00484" reg="mostcommon:Horton,nomatch:0" authname="horton"><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Captains</roleName> <surname full="yes">Horton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Farthing,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00485" reg="mostcommon:Farthing,nomatch:0" authname="farthing"><roleName n="Captain" full="yes" /><surname full="yes">Farthing</surname></persName>; and I will venture to say that no portion of the <rs>Southern</rs> people are represented by a braver, hardier, or more patriotic hand of men. They are all marksmen, accustomed to take a fine sight upon their object, and death is sure to follow the report of their rifles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932" />A large portion of them have left their farms and young families in the care of the old folks, and gone to distant and sickly portions of the republic, determined to drive back the <rs>Northern</rs> vandals, or perish in the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933" />While lately at the house of <persName n="Green,,Amos,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00486" reg="default:Green,Amos,,," authname="green,amos"><foreName full="yes">Amos</foreName> <surname full="yes">Green</surname></persName>, a citizen of Watanga, an honest and upright man, and a pure patriot, be told me that <num value="4">four</num> of his <num value="5">five</num> sons were in the army, and his wife joining in said, that if necessary the last <num value="1">one</num> should go, and the women would do the work them selves, though they had the families of a son and son-in-law to take care of, and needed his help very much, as the old man was so afflicted with rheumatism, as to be scarcely able to get about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934" />And such instances of self-sacrificing devotion to the cause are common in the county. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935" /> The imaginary line dividing Watanga from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825" authname="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> is a real fine of division in sentiment between her people and the traitors of that disaffected region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936" />And I am happy to be able to state, from personal knowledge, that they are as heartily united in the cause of the <rs>South</rs> as any people in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; and are determined to meet and drive back the <rs>Yankees</rs> and their allies, come they from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825" authname="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> or from any other quarter. </p>
