<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" /><placeName reg="Fort Gaines, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,2335258" authname="tgn,2335258">Fort Gaines</placeName> successfully, yet before operations against <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444" authname="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> could have been commenced, it would have been necessary, to have reduced that work, which is a very strong <num value="1">one</num>, and which was provisioned for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />We have before stated that the passage of these forts did not place <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444" authname="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> in imminent peril, and we may now add that neither does the fall of these works do so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344" /> the following prices are to be the maximum rates to be paid for the articles impressed in all cities and usual places of sale, and when impressed on the farms or elsewhere the same prices are to be paid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345" /> under existing circumstances we have deemed it not only just, but most likely to favor increased production, that producers in future should not be required to transport their surplus productions when impressed, but that the agents of the <rs>Government</rs> should employ or impress the neighborhood or county wagons and teams to haul all such articles, and so divide the work between the owners of wagons and teams as to be least prejudicial to those successfully engaged in agriculture. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347" /> In assessing the average value of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery and wagon horses and mules at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> we designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common sense import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348" />In other words, that they should be selected, and then impressed according as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the commissioners when they assessed the average value of such horses as the government needed at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>; but cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that <hi rend="italics">all horses</hi> at hand should be impressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349" />Yet. under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses, or brood mares of <hi rend="italics">admitted high value are</hi> impressed, we respectfully suggest to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi> in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horses or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class wagon mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350" /> The terms average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351" />we supposed that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or <num value="1">one</num> individual, that some might be estimated at <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure>, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure>--thus making <hi rend="italics">an-average</hi> value or price for a <hi rend="italics">number</hi> of good, sound, and efficient horses or mules <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352" /> In illustration of our views, we will add that a horse with only <num value="1">one</num> eye sound might, in all other respects, he classed as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, yet the loss of <num value="1">one</num> eye would justly and considerably curtail his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353" />So a horse from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, but, of course, however efficient, or able to render good service for a year or so, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354" />Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fall below the maximum price; and as few comparatively come up to the standard, and, therefore, are entitled to the maximum price, so of course in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced as imperfections place them below the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, &amp;c. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376" /> Since the adoption of our Schedules for the months of <dateStruct value="-02-" full="yes" authname="--02"><month reg="02" full="yes">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct full="yes"><month full="yes">March</month></dateStruct>, the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377" />At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was in a few days thereafter to be taxed <num value="33">thirty three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>- <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378" /> The <orgName n="State Board" type="board">Board of State</orgName> Commissioners having adjourned, and <num value="1">one</num> of its members being out of the <rs>State</rs>, it could not be convened in time to review our schedules of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379" />Under this state of facts, we have re-examined re-arranged our tariff of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing in this mode to render any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380" />Therefore, we stress the <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value of artillery or wagon horses or mules, imperiled since the passage of the currency, bill of the <dateStruct value="-02-17" full="yes" authname="--02-17"><day reg="17" full="yes">17th</day> <month reg="02" full="yes">February</month></dateStruct> last, at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>. This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation, accordingly as each herro or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> close artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing agents and officers should forth-with call on all of those persons of whom they impressed horses or mule and propose a settlement upon the foregoing basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381" />But allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our average appraisement, <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>, as a fair medium valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382" />This, then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">$800</measure> and a minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">$400</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure> the average price — thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class horses or mules, and proportionately less for the inferior, as they may fail below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.
