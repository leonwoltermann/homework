<head>The War in the <rs>Southwest</rs>.<lb />[<hi rend="italics">from our army correspondent</hi>]</head> <opener> <dateline> <name type="place">Corinth,</name> <date value="1862-05-26" authname="1862-05-26">May 26, 1862.</date> </dateline> </opener> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" /> In pursuance of a <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> issued <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> ago, the correspondents of the press now in the army have been tabooed from the lines, and ordered not to return within <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure> of the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />This will therefore be my last letter from this point, though my convictions of duty to your readers will induce me to remain in the vicinity and chronicle such events as may drift towards me from the now boiling cauldron of army life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />The merits or demerits of this demonstration against the liberties of the press, it is not my intention to discuss now. An ample opportunity will be afforded in the future when those who are at the bottom of the affair will be treated according to their just deserts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" /> No cause is assigned for the movement, and none that is reasonable exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />Every telegraphic dispatch is approved officially by the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs>, and if any improper information has been given to the public, it has been done with official sanction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />I learnt however, that <num value="1">one</num> of the correspondents was imprudent in writing a letter wherein certain movements were made public which it was desirable should be concealed, not only because of the information it gave to the enemy of <hi rend="italics">facts that had transpired,</hi> but from a desire to hide from the world the additional fact that there had been a failure to accomplish a certain object; not, however, resulting from the knowledge or strength of the enemy, but from certain natural obstacles which were unknown to our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" /> Other reasons may have induced this summary action; but why the sins of <num value="1">one</num> individual should be visited upon the entire representatives of the press and the people, to whom they bear the relation of mediums of communication from their relatives and friends in the army, is a mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />I remember that our worthy <rs type="role2">President</rs> scouted at the idea of tampering with the liberties of the press when the idea was suggested in Congress, as long as the press remained loyal and prudent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />Yet here is a direct interference And farther, I have been informed by <num value="1">one</num> of the officials that he intends to arrest every editor in the country who dares to publish any private intelligence that reflects upon the movements or organization of the army or any of its officials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />Your true, well informed, and prudent correspondent, will never publish such facts, and others bearing upon the welfare of the army; but in future the country will be flooded with the most absurd tales that ever deceived a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" /><num value="1">One</num> thing is certain, distinguished officers will no longer have their horses shot under them and their names blazoned in print.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />Paper <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">"riding through the thickest of the fire,"</q> will no longer exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />Official reports may give the skeleton, but the details of a battle will never reach the public eye. Instances of individual bravery will hereafter never make glad the hearts of the <rs>Southern</rs> people that the days of chivalry yet linger with us, and the wounded and dead will He and rot for weeks before their distant friends can be relieved of the agonizing suspense which follows every battle — all of which facts have heretofore been the them<unclear /> of the faithful, hard-working, plodding <q direct="unspecified">"army correspondent."</q> Individually we don't care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />We are banished, <q direct="unspecified">"but what's banished but set free."</q> The people will be the only sufferers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" /> As regards general <unclear>affairs,</unclear> everything remains in a quiescent attitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />A determined attack has recently been made on <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee" authname="tgn,6002083">Fort Pillow</placeName>, and a fight is pending at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023" authname="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />These <num value="2">two</num> events, should they prove successful to the <rs>Federal</rs> arms, may change the policy of <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Halleck,H.,W.,," authname="halleck,h.,w."><surname full="yes">Halleck</surname></persName> with reference to the coming battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />The opening of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> would enable him to throw a heavy body of troops into <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750" authname="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, and thence upon the left of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,Gen,,," authname="beauregard,gen"><surname full="yes">Beauregard</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />In fact, the <rs>Federal General</rs> is reported to have remarked that he would take <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi" authname="tgn,7017649">Corinth</placeName> without firing a gun. It may, therefore, be his design to await the demonstrations on the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />These are the only contingencies on which he can depend to carryout the programme thus enunciated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />The probabilities of a Federal success on the river is somewhat in their favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />According to the latest accounts, a strong force has landed at <placeName reg="Osceola, Mississippi, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009144" authname="tgn,2009144">Osceola</placeName>, which is near the point where the <name n="United States">Yankee</name> gunboats are stationed, and are now pushing down the river-bank on a road which will carry them to a point be low <placeName key="tgn,2101174" n="1.000 5" reg="randolph, tipton, tennessee" authname="tgn,2101174">Fort Randolph</placeName>, which is about <measure n="16miles" type="distance">sixteen miles</measure> this side of <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee" authname="tgn,6002083">Fort Pillow</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />In other words, it is a repetition of the <placeName reg="Island Number Ten, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2552260" authname="tgn,2552260">Island No.10</placeName> tactic, which caused an evacuation and surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" />Once fairly established on the banks, the <rs>Federal</rs> will bring down their heavy guns, and, by cutting off supplies, compel us to yield to starvation and to the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" /> I am not disposed to regard the opening of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> an event so certain as many anticipate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />Federal gunboats may, indeed, ply between <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604" authname="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> and New Orleans, but it would require half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men to protect the transports from the deadly fire of the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of independent sharpshooters and partisans who will line the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />It will be no easy matter to prevent a discharge of grape shot at every landing that will riddle the wooden steamers and their valuable cargoes, and this in itself constitutes an elephantine obstacle which the <rs>Federal</rs> cannot possibly surmount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />The fall of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750" authname="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023" authname="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> no more effects the general result than the capture of New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />They may be made <hi rend="italics">points d'appal</hi> for the operation of Federal armies, but each city will itself require an army to maintain its subordination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" /><num value="1">One</num> company of riflemen following their transports, and dodging among the trees and swamps, could do more damage in a month to their river trade than a year of Federal operations on land would compensate; and if I have not misapprehended the temper of the people, it will be done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" /> Affairs in <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172" authname="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> look equally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />The <rs>Yankees</rs> are overrunning the <rs>State</rs> and advancing southward, but the people are aroused and meeting them wherever they can. Cotton is being freely burned, and everything that is valuable to the enemy placed beyond reach. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" /> A telegraphic dispatch from <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023" authname="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> advises us that the gunboats have commenced to shell the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />Several privates residences have been damaged, but the batteries remain uninjured and nobody is hurt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" /> Of <num value="1">one</num> thing let your readers rest assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48" />The policy of concentration adopted by the <rs>President</rs> is destined to work out glorious results; and whatever may be the effect of military movements on the popular mind now, ultimately it will redound to our success — Overrun we can never be. Subjugation is impossible. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207" />There was also about <num value="30">thirty</num> anchors laid down into the bottom of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208" />So powerfully had this raft been built and fastened on both shores, and so thoroughly had it been anchored, that it was believed by those who constructed it that nothing save the giving away of the bottom of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> itself could break it. It was impossible for vessels to pass the forts while the raft was across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209" />It held <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, but was swept away finally by the high water, the rapid current and the drift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210" />A steamer and men were constantly employed to attend to the raft, and to keep away the drift, &amp;c., which however, it was found impossible to do. This raft cost not less than <num value="55000">fifty-five thousand</num> or <measure n="60000dollars" type="currency">sixty thousand dollars</measure>; and, had it not been for the new precedented high water, it is supposed that it would have answered the purpose for which it was intended. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211" /> After the raft was carried away another obstruction was placed across the river as soon as possible, by anchoring small vessels, and running chains from <num value="1">one</num> to the other, after their masses were removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212" />The men worked night and day to accomplish this.--The obstructions thus made remained in position until within <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> of the fight, when it, too, was carried in a storm by <num value="5">five</num> vessels breaking adrift above it and coming down against it, which they did with great violence, the current being very rapid and the wind blowing very hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213" />Vessels were immediately set to work to put this obstruction in position again, but the enemy would not allow them to do it, but fired upon them whenever they attempted it.
