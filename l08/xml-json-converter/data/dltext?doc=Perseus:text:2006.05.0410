<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" /> There are so many points of resemblance between the exigencies and trails of the revolution of <num value="176">176</num> and that now progressing in the <rs>South</rs>, that it is both instructive and encouraging to recur to the history of the former just at this time.

<head>The reverses of the revolutionary War.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" /> In the gloom which follows our recent reverses, we turn to the great example of our ancestors in a struggle very similar to that in which we are engaged, in its origin as well as its incidents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />The war of the <name>Revolution</name> was <num value="1">one</num> in which the disparity of the contending powers was far greater than at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />The <rs>British</rs> had every advantage that numbers, experience in warfare, and unlimited resources could give them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />The colonists were in awe of the superior skill and force of their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />They were almost without artillery, their small arms were of the most indifferent description, and insufficient for their troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />Their armies were badly clad and badly provided with stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />They were enlisted for very short terms, and therefore badly disciplined and drilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />The people of every colony were more or less divided in opinion as to the rightfulness of the contest, and some, as New York, furnished as many troops to <num value="1">one</num> side as the other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />The course of the contest was sufficient to have discouraged any but the most resolute natures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />The <rs>British</rs> had taken months for the most elaborate preparations to subdue the colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />They were supreme by sea. <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Lewis,,,:1" authname="washington,lewis"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Washington</surname></persName> had concentrated his forces at New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />He had <num value="27000">27,000</num> men. The enemy had <num value="24000">24,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />He undertook to defend <placeName key="tgn,7015824" n="1.000 2" reg="long island city, queens, new york" authname="tgn,7015824">Long Island</placeName>, upon which he erected defences and stationed troops.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />The American army was then in great part withdrawn from the city, but such was the terror inspired by the superior military skill attributed to the <rs>British</rs>, that the force stationed for the defence of a <orgName n="Water Battery" type="battery">water battery</orgName> fled from the bombardment of the enemy, and <num value="2">two</num> brigades, sent to their aid, were so infected with panic that they retreated without firing a gun or seeing the enemy, and in spite of the remonstrances of <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Lewis,,,:1" authname="washington,lewis"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Washington</surname></persName> and their own officers. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />The garrison made a gallant defence, killing several <num value="100">hundred</num> Hessians; but the <rs>British</rs> advanced in <num value="3">three</num> columns, and drove the garrison within the fort, where it surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" /><hi rend="italics">The <name>British</name> <measure n="2500" type="captured">captured two thousand five hundred</measure> men, with military stores, and a strong position.</hi> This was considered the greatest calamity of the war. <placeName key="tgn,2064769" n="1.000 1" reg="fort lee, bergen, new jersey" authname="tgn,2064769">Fort Lee</placeName> fell next — the troops were withdrawn, but <hi rend="italics">all the armament and supplies, including <num value="300">three hundred</num> tents, fell into the hands of the enemy.</hi> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270" />The populace of <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766" authname="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName> once more are making a dramatical demonstration against their rulers, and preparing to light again the flames of civil war. Time was when the <rs>South</rs>, which had been trained to echo the public sentiment of the <rs>North</rs>, and really believed that the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> were very much oppressed, sympathized with every popular movement which was started on that continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271" />But it has of late discovered that its worst enemies in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> are the insurrectionists, and its only friends the conservative classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272" />In <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766" authname="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>, the scene of the present agitations, and, we suppose, in most of the large <placeName reg="Italian">Italian</placeName> towns, it has been customary to dramatize the most execrable misrepresentations of slavery at the popular theatres, in which the character of the <rs>Southern</rs> people was painted in the most frightful colors, and a horrible retribution visited upon their wives and daughters in the midst of the most frenzied applause of the dirty mob whose imagined sorrows our people have so often and profoundly commiserated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273" /> The Southern revolution, which is a conservative and constitutional, and not a radical and agrarian movement, which has for its object the protection of property and constitutional liberty, has of course no friends among those who make war upon property and whose only idea of liberty is that which prevailed in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> revolution, and which perpetrated more horrors upon humanity than it had ever suffered from despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274" />We cannot expect the sympathies of such people in our cause, nor, now that we understand their true character, can they expect ours in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275" />The experience of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has satisfied us that the extremes of Democracy and Despotism gravitate towards each other, and that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> as naturally end in the last as the clouds dissolve in rain and the rivers empty into the sea. The section of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> which has always boasted of having the largest liberty, has proved itself more oppressive than any despot of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> in its treatment of the weaker section; and its chosen tools for their subjugation have been those very revolutionary emigrants whose sufferings we were won't to sympathize with in days gone by, and whose civil and religious rights the <rs>South</rs>, <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> ago, rescued from a Know Nothing Northern crusade, which, if successful, would have driven them back, as a lesser evil, to the despotisms from which they fled. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285" />We can respect even our honest Northern enemies, and we do respect them far more than the native born traitors who have plotted, toiled, and even fought to crush us to the dust.--hence it is that we rejoice to see that collapsed humbug, the late <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs>, left to drivel out his imbecile venom in New York, with none so poor as do him reverence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422" /> In obedience to the constitutional provision requiring the <rs>President</rs>, from time to time, to give to the <rs>Congress</rs> information of the state of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient, I have to communicate, that since my message at the last session of the <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">Provisional Congress</orgName>, events have demonstrated that the <rs>Government</rs> had attempted more than it had power successfully to achieve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423" />Hence, in the effort to protect, by our arms, the whole of the territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, seaboard and inland, we have been so exposed as recently to encounter serious disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424" />When the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was formed the <name>States</name> composing it were, by the peculiar character of their pursuits, and a misplaced confidence in their former associates, to a great extent, destitute of the means for the prosecution of the war on so gigantic a scale as that which it has attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425" />The workshops and artisans were mainly to be found in the <rs>Northern States</rs>; and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duties which devolved upon this Government was to establish the necessary manufactories, and in the meantime to obtain, by purchase from abroad, as far as practicable, whatever was required for the public defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426" />No effort has been spared to effect both these ends; and, though the results have not equalled our hopes, it is believed that an impartial judgement will, upon full investigation, award to the various departments of the <rs>Government</rs> credit for having done all which human power and foresight enabled them to accomplish. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427" /> The valor and devotion of the people have not only sustained the efforts of the <rs>Government</rs>, but have gone far to supply its deficiencies. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429" /> I have hoped for several days to receive official reports in relation to our discomfiture at <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345" authname="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, and the fall of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee" authname="tgn,7017741">Fort Donelson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430" />They have not yet reached me, and I am, therefore, unable to communicate to you such information of those events and the consequences resulting from them, as would enable me to make recommendations founded upon the changed condition which they have produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431" />Enough is known of the surrender at <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345" authname="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName> to make us feel that it was deeply humiliating, however imperfect may have been the preparations for defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432" />The hope is still entertained that our reported losses at <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee" authname="tgn,7017741">Fort Donelson</placeName> have been greatly exaggerated, inasmuch as I am not only unwilling, but unable to believe that a large army of our people have surrendered without a desperate effort to cut their way through investing forces, whatever may have been their numbers, and to endeavor to make a junction with other divisions of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433" />But in the absence of that exact information which can only be afforded by official reports, it would be premature to pass judgment, and my own is reserved, as I trust yours will be, until that information is received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434" />In the meantime, strenuous efforts have been made to throw forward reinforcements to the armies at the positions threatened, and I cannot doubt that the bitter disappointments we have borne, by nerving the people to still greater exertions, will speedily secure results more accordant with our just expectation, and as favorable to our cause as those which marked the earlier periods of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435" /> The reports of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretaries of War</rs> and the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> will exhibit the mass of resources for the conduct of the war which we have been enabled to accumulate, notwithstanding the very serious difficulties against which we have contended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436" /> They afford the cheering hope that our resources, limited as they were at the beginning of the contest, will, during its progress, become developed to such an extent as fully to meet our future wants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437" /> The policy of enlistment for short terms, against which I have steadily contended from the commencement of the war, has in my judgment, contributed in no immaterial degree to the recent reverses which we have suffered, and even now render it difficult to furnish you an accurate statement of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438" />When the war <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> broke out many of our people could with difficulty be persuaded that it would belong or serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439" />It was not deemed possible that anything so insane as a persistent attempt to subjugate these States could be made; still less that the delusion would so far prevail as to give to the war the vast proportions which it has assumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440" />The people, incredulous of a long war, were naturally averse to long enlistments, and the early legislation of Congress rendered it impracticable to obtain volunteers for a greater period than <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>. Now that it has become probable that the war will be continued through a series of years, our high-spirited and gallant soldiers, while generally re-enlisting, are, from the fact of having entered the service for a short term, compelled in many instances to go home to make the necessary arrangements for their families during their prolonged absence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441" /> The quotas of new regiments for the war, called for from the different States, are in rapid progress of organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442" />The whole body of new levies and re-enlisted men will probably be ready in the ranks within the next <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>. But, in the meantime, it is exceedingly difficult to give an accurate statement of the number of our forces in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443" />They may, in general terms, be stated at <num value="400">four hundred</num> regiments of infantry, with a proportionate force of cavalry and artillery, the details of which will be shown by the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444" />I deem it proper to advert to the fact that the process of furloughs and re-enlistment in progress for the last month had so far disorganized and weakened our forces as to impair our ability for successful defence; but I heartily congratulate you that this evil, which I had foreseen and was powerless to prevent, may now be said to be substantially at an end, and that we shall not again during the war be exposed to seeing our strength diminished by this fruitful cause of disaster — short enlistments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445" /> The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> being principally engaged in agricultural pursuits, were unprovided at the commencement of hostilities with ships, ship-yards, materials for ship- building, or skilled mechanics and seamen in sufficient numbers, to make the prompt creation of a navy a practical task even if the required appropriations had been made for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446" />Notwithstanding our very limited resources, however, the report of the <rs>Secretary</rs> will exhibit to you a satisfactory progress in preparation, and a certainty of early completion of vessels of a number and class on which we may confidently rely for contesting the vaunted control of the enemy over our waters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447" /> The financial system devised by the wisdom of your predecessors, has proved adequate to supplying all the wants of the <rs>Government</rs>, notwithstanding the unexpected and very large increase of expenditures resulting from the great augmentation in the necessary means of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448" />The report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, will exhibit the gratifying fact, that we have no floating debt; that the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> is unimpaired and that the total expenditure of the <rs>Government</rs> for the year, has been, in round numbers, <num value="170000000">one hundred and seventy millions</num> of dollars; less than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the sum wasted by the enemy, in his vain effort to conquer us — less than the value of a single article of export — the cotton crop of the year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449" /> The report of the <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster-General</rs> will show the condition of that Department to be steadily improving — its revenues increasing, and already affording the assurance that it will be self-sustaining at the date required by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, while affording ample mail facilities for the people. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453" /> In conclusion, I cordially welcome Representatives who, recently chosen by the people, are fully imbued with their views and feelings, and can so ably advise me as to the needful provisions for the public service.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795" /> Before the commencement of this unholy war upon us, many good patriots differed us to the proper course in be pursued for the protection of our liberties and our rights but the <rs>Northern Government</rs> and people have long since swept away all possible ground of difference among Southern men who desire to be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796" />The questions which once separated us in opinion no longer exists, and those who were formerly Union men in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> have the greatest cause for irreconcilable hostility to the <rs>Northern</rs> traitors who sought to entrap them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797" />Without referring to the long train or usurpations and enormities committed by our enemies, it is only necessary to state their present position in regard to us. Under the pretence of restoring the <rs>Union</rs> they are seeking to dismember <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; with professions of devotion to the <rs>Constitution</rs> they propose to convert the <rs>Southern States</rs> into dependent Territories, and to confiscate the property of the citizens of these State for the payment of the enormous debt they have contracted, and the reward of the mercenary soldiers they have sent against us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798" /> The struggle on our part is for existence itself, and the question is, whether the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> shall remain free, self governing communities, or become Territorial appendages of an odious Northern despotism, ruled by Northern Governors, and overrun by Northern tax-gatherers and each <unclear> ators.</unclear> In this struggle we will most assuredly prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799" />The duration of the struggle, however, and the amount of suffering consequent on it, will depend on the promptness with which the people will respond to the call of the <rs>Government</rs> for troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800" />To stand all of in this struggle is to give aid and comfort to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801" />his calculations now are, that the terms of many of our soldiers will shortly expire, and their places will not be filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802" />This army will respond nobly to the call made upon it, but circumstances of the most urgent necessity will impel some in its ranks to retire for a time at the expiration of their present terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803" />Will you not take their places?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804" />Is there <num value="1">one</num> among you who dare look forward to the period in after years, when — this war having come to a successful issue, and peace and prosperity smiling upon a happy land — he will be compelled to confess to his own children, that he remained an inactive spectator of this greatest of our wars for independence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805" />If there is, whatever his professed faith, let him not murmur if the name of tory shall stick to him like the shirt of <persName n="Nessus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00613" reg="mostcommon:Nessus,nomatch:0" authname="nessus"><surname full="yes">Nessus</surname></persName> through all his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807" /> I hope that the appeal I make to you will be responded to in a manner worthy of the cause, and that the ranks of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 24">24th regiment</orgName> will be filled at once from the counties from which it was originally formed, without the necessity of a resort to a draft. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809" />It was originally my own regiment, and I feel a peculiar interest in its. I have great faith in the regiment, and those who now join it will find themselves sustained by men of brave hearts and strong arms, whose former experience will be of great and vantage to them. </p>
