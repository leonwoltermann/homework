<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649" /> A mighty and systematic effort has been made by merchants and bankers at the <rs>North</rs> to transfer to, and engross almost the entire profits of Southern trade in their own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650" />Our institutions have been decried to the world, in the hope that by this means they might drive from us the sympathies of other commercial nations, and obstruct, if not wholly prevent, direct intercourse between us and them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651" /> With these facts before us, is it not time we should awaken to the vital importance of instant, wise and decided action upon this subject? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652" /> <num value="1">One</num> of the greatest obstacles in the way of the establishment of direct trade with foreign countries — immediately upon the opening of the ports of our Confederacy — is the fact that our merchants are comparatively unknown in foreign markets, and have no credit established there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653" />Although the products of the <rs>Southern States</rs> have constituted the basis of credits and exchange between the late <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and those nations for more than <num value="0.5">a half</num> century; in a financial and commercial sense, we are unknown to each other — our bills of exchange having been drawn by Northern houses, and the vast amount of their productions consumed by us — imported through the same channel — so little have we been known in these transactions, that years would be required, in the ordinary course of events, to build up that trade and establish that confidence which is absolutely necessary in commercial transactions, which are founded on a system of credits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654" /> It is clear, therefore, that some extraordinary measures must be devised, to enable us to free ourselves from these impediments to our commercial credit and independence, and prevent our falling back into the old channel as soon as our ports are again open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655" />It is, moreover, desirable that our products, other than our great staple, should be fully made known to the world, and the great advantage to foreign nations of a direct trade with us, and we should all unite our efforts in the promotion of this great work. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656" /> We therefore cordially invite the merchants, bankers and others of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, to meet us in Mass Convention, in the city of <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980" authname="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName>, on the <date value="10-11" authname="10-11">11th day of October</date> next, for the purpose of devising some plan for establishing a system of credits between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName> and foreign countries, which may be practicable and available to all desiring to use it, and which will also command the hearty support of the citizens of our whole country. </p>
