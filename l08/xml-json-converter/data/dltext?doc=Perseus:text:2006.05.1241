<milestone unit="sentence" n="235" />The <hi rend="italics">News</hi> observes that they are, in general, able bodied men, and thinks they could give a better proof of their devotion to Dixie by fighting her battles than talking in New York hotels.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237" /> The censure of the <hi rend="italics">News</hi> is well deserved, and applies to a class of people for whom very little respect is entertained in either country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239" />Such shameful desertion of their native land, in her hour of need, called forth the indignant denunciations of the <rs>British</rs> press, and has not been forgotten to this day. We never heard, however, that any of them sought refuge in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, the enemy of their, country, and, compromised with their conscience by spouting <persName n="Bullism,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="default:Bullism,John,,," authname="bullism,john"><foreName full="yes">John</foreName> <surname full="yes">Bullism</surname></persName> in <name>French</name> coffee-rooms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240" /> If it were disgraceful for Englishmen to forsake their country at a period of merely apprehended danger — a danger which was never realized — what must be thought of those who go abroad, either to the <rs>North</rs> or <rs>Europe</rs> and leave a land struggling, like this, <unclear>amid</unclear> the existing and appalling realities of the most fearful contest ever waged on this continent?--What must be thought of able-bodied men who leave old men and children to fight their battles and defend their property whilst they are luxuriating in the ease and security of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, and showing their patriotism by disgusting laudations of the courage and self-sacrifice of their brave countrymen?--qualities which they take excellent care never to imitate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241" />We advise them to keep silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242" />Let them carry that discretion, which is the better part of valor, into their tongues as well as their legs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243" />Europeans understand them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244" />When an oppressed <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe," authname="tgn,1000003">European</placeName> nation rises in arms, it is the custom of its exiles residing in other parts of the world to rush home to the assistance of their fatherland.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245" />When people rush from their country at the moment she most requires their services, they may make sure of the universal contempt of all mankind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246" /> We believe that even the <rs>Yankees</rs> entertain at this moment more respect for those Confederates who are fighting, suffering and dying for their homes and firesides than the loud-talking and fugacious patriots who have deserted their country in the hour of her extremity and betaken themselves to the <rs>North</rs> or to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247" />When a man goes bodily to the enemy, we call it desertion and punish it as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248" />But open desertion is more manly, because it is more perilous and free from hypocrisy than a miserable sneaking out of the contest by the back door under the various contemptible pretexts and pretences which are so often set up for running the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249" />This act has all the meanness of desertion without its candor and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250" />We make no allusions, of course, to agents of the <rs>Government</rs> sent abroad to conduct official business, nor to such as go abroad for a short time in good faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251" />But there are others, and, we blush to say, not a few, who are making themselves conspicuous in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> by their loquacious patriotism, who are neither more nor less than hypocritical deserters from the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252" /> Who would not rather be the poorest Confederate soldier, of whom even <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0" authname="sherman"><surname full="yes">Sherman</surname></persName> says that they are the best soldiers in the world, and that after such a defence as they have made, the <rs>South</rs> would have no cause of humiliation even if she were conquered,--who would not rather be <num value="1">one</num> of the poorest and humblest of these heroes than the parlor knights, who are talking such pretty Confederate talk amid the luxuries and gaieties of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, flourishing carving knives, whilst their brethren at home are thrust through with bayonets and draining goblets of wine, whilst their brethren at home are drained of the last drop of their heroic blood?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253" />Surely these comfortable patriots do not look far into the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254" />If the <rs>Confederacy</rs> triumphs, they cannot expect to return here at the end of the war and hold up their heads in a community which they have abandoned to its fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255" />And if the <rs type="place">Confederacy falls</rs>, they need not expect even from Yankeedom as much consideration as the manly and gallant defenders of their soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260" /> A correspondent of the <orgName n="Wilmington Journal" type="newspaper">Wilmington <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi></orgName> gives an interesting account of the recent chase of the <rs>Tallahassee</rs>, going into that port, by the <rs>Federal</rs> blockaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261" />He says: </p> <cit><q rend="break" direct="unspecified"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262" /> When matters <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> became interesting, the <rs>Tallahassee</rs> was steering E. N. E., with the <rs>Lilian</rs> forward of the starboard beam, distant about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, and edging down to cut us off; the fellow with square sails was nearly abeam, with about the same distance between us.--The <rs>Montgomery</rs>, a <num value="3">three</num>-masted propeller, was on the starboard quarter, and distant about <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>. The <rs>Tallahassee</rs> had about <measure n="10l." type="pounds"><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> of steam; and it was evident she was not gaining on the <rs>Lilian</rs>, which vessel was then to be feared, as she was getting in our track; and still another vessel appeared about this time on the port bow. In trim, with plenty of steam, the gallant racer would have dashed between them like a dolphin, but unfortunately the cleaning and repairs had taken more time than was expected, and in consequence steam was down, and <measure n="9days" type="date">nine days</measure> consumption of fuel had so lightened the vessel that her screws were not perfectly submerged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263" />Under these disadvantages she came to the score, pressed by <num value="3">three</num> cruisers, chosen, no doubt, for the present service on account of their speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264" />As I have before remarked, the <rs>Lilian</rs> was holding on like a beagle and forging ahead to block the way to seaward.
