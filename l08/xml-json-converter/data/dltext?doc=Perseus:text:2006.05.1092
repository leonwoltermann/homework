<milestone unit="sentence" n="420" />We resume the subject this morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421" /> In the year <dateStruct value="1861--" full="yes" authname="1861"><year reg="1861" full="yes">1861</year></dateStruct> the cotton of all sorts imported amounted to within a fraction of <measure n="1900000000pounds" type="mass">1,900,000,000 lbs.</measure>, or about <measure n="4750000barrels" type="mass">4,750,000 bales</measure> of <measure n="400l." type="pounds"><num value="400">400</num> pounds</measure> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422" />Of this quantity nearly <num value="9">nine</num>- <num value=".1">tenths</num> came from the <rs>Southern States</rs> of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460" authname="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, so large was the proportion which it was found necessary to work into the inferior staples from other countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423" />For this cotton £<num value="36000000">36,000,000</num> sterling were paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424" />It was imported in <dateStruct value="1860--" full="yes" authname="1860"><year reg="1860" full="yes">1860</year></dateStruct>, the year of largest importation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425" />When manufactured and sold this cotton brought £<num value="56000000">56,000,000</num> sterling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426" />The year <dateStruct value="1862--" full="yes" authname="1862"><year reg="1862" full="yes">1862</year></dateStruct> was the year of least importation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427" />That year but <measure n="525000000pounds" type="mass">525,000,000 lbs.</measure> from all countries were imported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428" />It, nevertheless, cost £<num value="35000000">35,000,000</num> sterling, and when worked up, sold for £<num value="80000000">80,000,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429" />When we reflect upon the immense population that must have been thrown out of employment by the fall in the importation from nearly <measure n="2000000000pounds" type="mass">2,000,000,000 lbs.</measure> to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of that amount, we may readily infer that labor became very cheap and profits very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430" />The manufacturers, therefore, had no reason to be discontented with the existing state of affairs, and they are charged with using every effort to prolong it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431" /> The association for keeping up the supply of cotton, composed principally, we presume, of manufacturers, has in the meantime busily employed itself in making up reports to satisfy Parliament with the present condition of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432" />Parliament gets its information from the <orgName n="Trade Board" type="board">Board of Trade</orgName>, and the <orgName n="Trade Board" type="board">Board of Trade</orgName> from the <rs>Cotton Supply Association</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433" />In <dateStruct value="1863--" full="yes" authname="1863"><year reg="1863" full="yes">1863</year></dateStruct> there was a considerable increase in the supply over the preceding year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434" />This increase was occasioned principally by the increased success of the blockade runners, and the successful transfer of cotton to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893" authname="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and other countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435" />In such cases the association always gave the country from which the cotton was re-shipped credit for having produced it; a palpable fraud, evidently designed to make the public satisfied with things as they are, and to aid the <name>Ministry</name> in sustaining their so called neutral policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436" />The fact is that there has been no increase of cotton in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893" authname="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and very little in other parts of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437" />In <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat" authname="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> it is well ascertained that not more than <measure n="2000000barrels" type="mass">2,000,000 bales</measure> were ever produced in a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438" />The impression that it is a great cotton growing country, arises from its having produced cotton from time immemorial, but it is altogether a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439" />About <measure n="150000barrels" type="mass">150,000 bales</measure> were exchanged for <name>Yankee</name> goods, afterwards brought into the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440" />But for that supply Yankeedom would have been compelled to buy its cotton in <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597" authname="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441" /> These frauds, practised in the interest of Yankeedom, to prevent the recognition of these States, and the opening of the ports, are likely, we are pleased to see, to bring retribution in their train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442" />The supply of our cotton is so small, and it is so absolutely impossible to make tolerable goods of that imported from <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat" authname="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> and other countries without intermixing some other material, that the manufacturers have been making use of mineral and other foreign substances to supply the place of our staple, heretofore used in working them up. The consequence has been a deterioration of quality so serious that <name>British</name> cotton goods are in a fair way to lose their character in all the markets of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443" />Every man outside of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> who loves justice must rejoice that it is so. For this stupendous fraud the <rs>British</rs> people have had to pay through the nose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444" />The whole weight of the population thrown out of employment has been sustained by them for the benefit, it seems, of the manufacturers, who laugh and grew fat while their workmen are starving. </p> </div3>
