<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />The <num value="2">two</num> together were no such disaster as the defeat of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0" authname="hood"><surname full="yes">Hood</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" />The only important loss in that place is the cotton, which ought to have been destroyed, even if it involved the destruction of that enterprising New England city. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />Ever since the downfall of the <name>Tory</name> party and the predominance in the national councils of the commercial interest, national chivalry has been dead in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />The Tories, with all their faults and errors, were the true representatives of the <rs>British Lion</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />Even an idiot can understand that she only used anti-slavery as a wedge to accomplish the disruption of a hated and formidable power, and hence, now that her object is accomplished, she preserves a "rigid neutrality," and takes sides with neither "belligerent." </p>
