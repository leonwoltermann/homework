<milestone unit="sentence" n="363" /> We need no better sign of the complete triumph of Abolitionism in the <rs>Northern Government</rs> than the shifting of sail by the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, which, from having been the bitter denouncer of the <name>Abolitionists</name> and their councils, charging upon them and their confiscation schemes the prolongation of the war, now gives in its approval of the measure for abolishing slavery, with compensation, as just and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364" />It goes further and acquiesces in the evident ultimatum of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>, that if abolition with compensation is rejected, then there must be abolition without it. It speaks of an interview between delegates in Congress from the border States and the <rs>President</rs> on this subject and the confiscation hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365" />The <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> declares that the <rs>President</rs> yielded nothing to their remonstrances, but pointed out to them the strait to which the border States were reduced, intimating that they had better come down gracefully and get pay. The delegates are represented to have gone off to consider the matter, and the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> infers that they are not likely to quarrel with their <q direct="unspecified">"bread and butter"</q>--in other words that they will not prove rebellious, and that they will go home and advise their constituents to fall down and worship the <rs>Washington Juggernaut</rs> while the wheels of his tyranny grind them into dust. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366" /> There is nothing in the recent uncontrolled and uncontrollable away of the <name>Abolitionists</name> at the <rs>North</rs> to alarm the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367" />Since the war began it has been virtually <num value="1">one</num> of robbery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368" />The daily journals <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> have furnished the daily evidence of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369" />The Federal invaders have never spared the property of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370" />The slaves were always taken when they could be transported, or when they could be induced to leave their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379" />As a sequel to the last bold step, they have only to pass the measure enlisting and arming the slaves, to complete their new system of crushing the rebellion.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383" /> The South defies them, as it has from the beginning and will to the bitter end. The people of the <rs>South</rs> know that there is neither reason nor humanity at the <rs>North</rs>--that they can only protect their rights from insatiable rapacity and the most malignant destructiveness by their own courage and constancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384" />They have no hope but this.
