<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110" />The following is the report of the <rs>Committee</rs> of <num value="9">Nine</num>, to whom were referred the several prepositions relating to the condition of the country: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111" />The committee have been deeply impressed with the importance and with the difficulty of the duty assigned to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112" />They have examined with care all the various resolutions which have been referred to them, and have not lost sight of the subsequent suggestions which have been made in debate by members of this body from many different parts of our country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113" /> In framing the resolutions which they have at length, after much deliberation, agreed upon, they have had <num value="3">three</num> leading objects in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114" />They have designed to leave no room for honest doubt, or even for invidious misconstruction, as to the hearty loyalty of this body to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115" />They have desired to confirm and strengthen the unity of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, as represented in this Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116" />And they have attempted so to refer to the course of our brethren who are not represented here as to shut no door of reconciliation which is still open, and to afford the best hope that they may still be induced to reconsider and retrace their steps, and to renew their relations, in <name>Christian</name> love and loyalty, to a common Church and a common country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117" />The committee have felt that it was not fit for this Convention to act or to speak as if they despaired, or in any degree doubted, of the ultimate restoration of the legitimate National authority over our whole land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118" />They have felt, too, that the question before them was not so much as to what might be done, or what might be said, by this body, as a matter of stern justice, in vindication of the authority or the dignity of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, but as to what it was wise to do or say at this moment, consistently with our own convictions, and with a view to preserve, unbroken and undisturbed, every remaining link or tie of religious association and <name>Christian</name> sympathy which might be of use hereafter in accomplishing the great end of restoring our <orgName n="National Union" type="newspaper">National Union</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119" />The committee are unwilling to conclude their report without <num value="1">one</num> other suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120" />While there could have been no hesitation, under any circumstances, in expressing now and always our earnest and abiding loyalty and devotion to our country, its Constitution, and its laws, and to all its duly constituted authorities they have felt that there yet rested upon this Convention the most solemn obligation to abstain from entering upon any narrower questions, which peculiarly belong to the domain of secular polities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121" />Our blessed <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, in declaring that His kingdom was not of this world, and in directing u — to render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, h — clearly taught us that, whether as ministers or as legislators and councillors of His Church, we are to refrain from those matters which He has not committed to our care. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122" />There is doubtless a difficulty in the minds of many in clearly discerning the precise boundary line between the subjects which come within our jurisdiction and the proper sphere of duty as <name>Christian</name> ministers and ecclesiastical counsellors, and such as belong exclusively to secular politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123" />But the committee can hardly doubt that there will be a general concurrence in the opinion that, in this meet critical period in the history of our Church and of our country, when words are things, and when rash utterances at <num value="1">one</num> end of the <rs>Union</rs> may co-operate with rash acts at the other in extinguishing the best hopes which remain to us, it is wise for such a body as this to err on the safe side, if we must err at all; and to keep ourselves clearly within the limits which the councils of our Church have hitherto so uniformly observed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124" /> In accordance with these general views, the undersigned recommend the adoption of the following resolutions: </p> <cit><q direct="unspecified">
