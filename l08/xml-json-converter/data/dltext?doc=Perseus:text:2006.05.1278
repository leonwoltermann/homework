<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90" /> And whereas, the said correspondence was accompanied by an approving editorial, characterised by the same tone and spirit as the correspondence itself; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91" /> And whereas, the said correspondence and editorial, headed and paraded as aforesaid, are calculated to mislead the public judgment, and, in their temper and spirit, impute to Congress folly, disloyalty, treason and treachery; be it therefore. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92" /> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That, so far as the statements and imputations contained in the said correspondence and editorial were intended to apply to this branch of Congress, they are false in fact and inference; are an infringement of the privileges of its members; and merit the emphatic rebuke and unqualified denunciations of this <name>House</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93" /> The motion to suspend, to allow the introduction of the resolution, resulted — ayes, <num value="32">32</num>; noes, <num value="36">36</num>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95" /> When this was announced, I felt extremely indignant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96" />You will appreciate my feelings when I say that, being a member of the assailed committee, looking upon the <rs type="place">House</rs> as the natural guardian of that committee, and of all its committees, I expected protection, and not abandonment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97" /> I immediately determined to withdraw from the <rs type="place">House</rs>, not willing to sit there under the shadow of an impeachment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98" />In pursuance of this determination, I said: </p> <cit><q rend="break" direct="unspecified">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100" />But the vote of this <name>House</name>, in refusing to allow the introduction of the resolution of the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 6199" reg="georgia" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> (<persName n="Lester,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Lester,nomatch:0" authname="lester"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lester</surname></persName>) places this matter in a more serious aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101" />I consider that vote as, to some extent, endorsing the <hi rend="italics">Sentinel.</hi> As long as that vote stands as the sense of this body, I can take no part in its deliberations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102" />I say this in perfect respect to the members here; and I do not wish my withdrawal to be considered as at all contemptuous, but dictated solely by that self- respect-which I feel, and by which I have, through life, endeavored to be governed. </p> </q><bibl default="NO" /></cit> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105" /> The article in the <hi rend="italics">Sentinel</hi> did not refer to me in person, or to any individual member of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, but was a sweeping charge against those members of Congress who favored the proposed peace measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202" /> Whilst we were looking at <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina" authname="tgn,6002050">Fort Fisher</placeName> under the <rs>Federal</rs> flag, and rejoicing over its downfall, a tremendous explosion took place in its very centre, sounding louder than the boom of a <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15 inch</measure> gun. A volume of smoke and sand rose <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> in the air, enveloping and hiding from view the whole of this immense work for <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>. It was at once apparent that the magazine had exploded, and that it must have been accompanied with great loss of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203" />We soon after learned that the destruction of life was not less than <num value="200">two hundred</num>, including many sailors from the fleet who had not yet returned to their ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204" />It was occasioned by the carelessness of some of the colored troops in carrying candles into the magazine. </p> </q></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205" /> A large quantity of <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs> had been found stored in a magazine, which the colored soldiers had freely used for their breakfasts, not knowing that it also contained a ton or more of powder, underneath the meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206" />The exact manner in which the fire was communicated cannot, of course, be known, but it is presumed that there was some loose powder on the floor, into which a spark fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207" />It was a terrible event, so soon following our great victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208" />I have heard the names of some regiments that are said to have suffered most, but for fear that my intelligence may not be reliable, it were, perhaps, better not to mention them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209" /> Various rumors were afloat with regard to this terrible catastrophe, some attributing it to the work of a torpedo; but on inquiring, I learn that it was undoubtedly the result of carelessness, or rather the lack of knowledge of the presence of powder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210" /> The loss of life by the explosion, I learn, is about <num value="200">two hundred</num>, besides quite a number wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211" />The magazine that exploded was in the very centre of the parade, and it has scooped out the earth to a great depth for <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> around, and added to the desolation that reigns in this vast monument of engineering ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212" />Quite a number of sailors from the fleet and some officers also suffered from this explosion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213" />They had gone ashore to examine the work, and fell victims to their excusable curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214" />The paymasters of the <rs>Gettysburg</rs> and the <rs>Ticonderoga</rs>, and an ensign from the <rs>Gettysburg</rs>, are reported among the victims. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216" /> As I informed you in my last, we had commenced operations with the iron vessels, which bombarded while we landed the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217" />On the <dateStruct value="--14" full="yes" authname="---14"><day reg="2" full="yes">14th</day></dateStruct>, I ordered all the vessels carrying <measure n="11inch" type="distance">eleven- inch</measure> guns to bombard with the <rs>Ironsides</rs>, the <rs>Brooklyn</rs> taking the lead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218" />By sunset the fort was reduced to a pulp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219" />Every gun was silenced by being injured or covered with earth so that they would not work. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220" /> On the <dateStruct value="--15" full="yes" authname="---15"><day reg="2" full="yes">15th</day></dateStruct>, <persName n="Terry,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="mostcommon:Terry,nomatch:0" authname="terry"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Terry</surname></persName> and myself arranged for the assault, and I ordered <num value="1400">fourteen hundred</num> sailors and marines to participate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221" />At daylight the iron <term type="ship">vessels</term>, the <rs type="ship">Brooklyn</rs> and <measure n="11inch" type="distance">eleven-inch</measure> gunboats commenced battering the work, while the troops made a lodgment within <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222" />At <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time>, all the vessels steamed in and took their stations, opening a heavy fire, which was kept up until <time value="3pm">3 P. M.</time>, when the signal was made to assault, the soldiers taking the land side and the sailors the sea face, the ships changing, but not stopping their fire to the other works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223" />The rebels met us with a courage worthy of a better cause, and fought desperately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224" />About <num value="30">thirty</num> of the sailors and officers succeeded in getting to the top of the parapet amidst a murderous fire of grape and canister and musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225" />They had planted the flag there, but were swept away in a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226" />Others tried to get up the steep <hi rend="italics">pan coupee.</hi> The marines could have cleared the parapet by keeping up a steady fire, but they failed to do so, and the sailors were repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227" />Many a gallant fellow fell trying to emulate their brothers in arms who were fighting to obtain an entrance on the northeast angle, as it appears on our chart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228" /> The enemy mistook the seamen's attack for the main body of troops, and offered a most vigorous resistance there, but I witnessed it all, and think the <milestone unit="column" n="5" /> marines could have made the assault successful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229" /> In the meantime our gallant soldiers had gained a foothold on the northwest corner of the fort, fighting like lions and contesting every inch of ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230" />The Ironsides and monitors kept throwing their shells into the traverses not occupied by our men, but occupied by the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231" />In this way our troops fought from traverse to traverse from <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> in the afternoon until <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> at night, when the joyful tidings were signalled to the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232" />We stopped our fire and gave them <num value="3">three</num> of the heartiest cheers I ever heard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233" /> It has been the most terrific struggle I ever saw, with very much hard labor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234" /> The troops had covered themselves with glory, and <persName n="Terry,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Terry,nomatch:0" authname="terry"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Terry</surname></persName> is my <hi rend="italics">beau ideal</hi> of a soldier and a general.--Our operations have been most harmonious, and I think the <rs>General</rs> will do the navy the credit to say that this time, at least, we substantially injured the fort as a defensive work. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236" />This time the works were fully manned, and contained about <num value="800">eight hundred</num> men at the time of the assault. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237" /> It is a matter of regret to me to see my gallant officers and men so cut up, but I was unwilling to let the troops undertake the capture of the works without the navy's sharing with them the peril all were anxious to undergo, and we should have had the honor of meeting our brothers-in-arms in the works had the sailors been properly supported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238" />We have lost about <num value="200">two hundred</num> men in killed and wounded, and amongst them some gallant officers. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273" />The decline in gold has been very rapid within the past <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>. On Thursday the brokers refused to buy at <hi rend="italics"><num value="50">fifty</num>,</hi> and a number of the hoarders of specie were upon the street, anxious to sell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274" />Yesterday, gold was very dull at <num value="47">forty seven</num> and <num value="8">eight</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275" />In the afternoon, several small sums were sold at the latter price, though the market, at a later hour, had a downward tendency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276" /> Several causes have combined to bring about this effect:--the strenuous measures recommended by <persName n="Trenholm,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Trenholm,G.,A.,,:9" authname="trenholm,g.,a."><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Trenholm</surname></persName>. <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, to Congress; the decided action of that body in determining, by a vote of <hi rend="italics"><num value="43">forty-three</num></hi> yeas to <hi rend="italics"><num value="31">thirty-one</num></hi> nays, to seize all the cotton and tobacco in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> on Government account; and the closing of the port of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631" authname="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277" />The scheme of finance now determined upon, and likely to be carried into effect, may be comprehensively stated thus: The cotton and tobacco of the country, having been made the property of the <rs>Government</rs>, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> will proceed, under authority of Congress, to borrow specie, giving cotton and tobacco as security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278" />This specie will be speedily applied to the redemption of a large portion of the <rs>Confederate</rs> notes now afloat at a moderate discount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279" />No more notes to be issued by the <name>Department</name>; but the incoming currency to be used for Government expenditure or cancelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280" />The cotton and tobacco seized will be paid for in Confederate money at the market rates (gold being the basis), at the rate of discount fixed by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> in the redemption of the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281" />An effort will be made to reduce the volume of the currency to a certain amount, and, if possible, to prevent its increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282" />This course of policy, although not formally entered upon, has, nevertheless, already been somewhat effective. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284" />The public are not aware of the vast amount of influence exercised over the gold market by the operations of the blockade-running at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631" authname="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285" />From <hi rend="italics"><num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> to <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> dollars</hi> in gold were required to meet the weekly demands of the buyers, and nearly all the gold drawn from the market flowed out through that channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288" />Immediately gold rose to <num value="71">seventy-one</num>, and for several days continued to advance, through the combined influence of the brokers, till it reached <hi rend="italics"><num value="76">seventy-six</num>;</hi> but here it stopped, and has since had a steady downward tendency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289" /> So far, then, as the monetary affairs of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> are concerned, our prospects are brighter than for many days past; and should our currency continue to improve under the wholesome treatment now advised and in contemplation, our prospects in other points of view cannot grow worse. </p> </div3>
