<milestone unit="sentence" n="324" />The <rs>Romans</rs>, according to their customs, placed their cavalry on their wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327" />With <num value="6000">6,000</num> cavalry he fell upon the <rs>Roman</rs> cavalry on the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, routed it, and sent a body of horsemen after them, who put them to the sword to a man. With the remainder he galloped entirely around the rear of his own army, and united his troops to the rest of the cavalry on his left, who were already engaged in a desperate combat with the <name>Romans</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328" />His arrival instantly decided the comment, for he attacked the <name>Romans</name>, already outnumbered and hard pressed in flank and rear with his additional force, which of itself was nearly double as large as theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329" />The <name>Roman</name> cavalry instantly gave way, and he sent a body of horsemen to pursue them along the <name>Aufidus</name>, who executed their orders with such good will that <persName n="Polybius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00296" reg="mostcommon:Polybius,nomatch:0" authname="polybius"><surname full="yes">Polybius</surname></persName> tells us only <num value="70">70</num> men escaped out of the whole body of Roman and auxiliary cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330" />Having entirely destroyed the <rs>Roman</rs> cavalry, <persName n="Asdrubal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00297" reg="mostcommon:Asdrubal,nomatch:0" authname="asdrubal"><surname full="yes">Asdrubal</surname></persName> prepared himself for a still more important service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331" />While the cavalry combats were going on upon his wings, <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00298" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0" authname="hannibal"><surname full="yes">Hannibal</surname></persName> had formed his centre in <unclear> such</unclear> a manner that its front presented the appearance of a presence, whose convex was opposed to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332" />The <rs>Romans</rs> assaulted it, and as it gave way in its centre, they pursued for a mile without adverting to the fact that they had placed themselves between <num value="2">two</num> powerful bodies of heavy armed troops, <num value="1">one</num> on each flank, which wheeled to the right and left and assaulted them as soon as the troops which they were pursuing halted and opposed a resistance to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333" />The ranks of the <name>Romans</name> were so crowded that it was impossible to preserve order or to use their arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334" />At this moment <persName n="Asdrubal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00299" reg="mostcommon:Asdrubal,nomatch:0" authname="asdrubal"><surname full="yes">Asdrubal</surname></persName> again made his appearance on the stage, closing up the rear of the <name>Romans</name> and charging their crowded, broken and confused ranks with inconceivable fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335" />The most terrible slaughter recorded in the history of battles ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336" />Out of <num value="26000">26,000</num> men, <num value="70000">70,000</num> were slain on the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337" />On the field <num value="10000">10,000</num> were made prisoners, and <num value="3000">3,000</num> more that had been left to guard the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338" />Out of the whole body only <num value="3000">3,000</num> men escaped, and of these but <num value="70">70</num>, as we have said, were cavalry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339" /> The powerful agency of cavalry in all these battles, and especially that last named, induced the historian to whom we have alluded, who was also an experienced soldier, to make the remarks touched upon above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340" />But it is of the utmost importances in siting these examples, to take into consideration the nature of the ground on which all these battles were fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341" />It was in every instance, level, unbroken, and without wood or coppice, on the immediate spot where the cavalry acted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342" />At the <name>Trebbia</name> there were thickets on the banks of the giver, in which an ambush was laid, and the larger part of the <name>Carthaginian</name> army was concealed among the woods of the hills that enclose the lake at Thrasymans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343" />But the ground the cavalry noted on appears to have been clear and unobstructed in every instance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344" /> So it was at <placeName reg="Marengo, McHenry, Illinois" key="tgn,2028962" authname="tgn,2028962">Marengo</placeName>, which is a vast plain, where, by the by, it is still a subject of dispute whether the charge of Kellerman or the arrival of Dessix decided the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345" />Bourienne (who descried and betrayed <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00300" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0" authname="napoleon"><surname full="yes">Napoleon</surname></persName>) and Kellerman himself assort the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346" /><persName n="Allison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00301" reg="mostcommon:Allison,nomatch:0" authname="allison"><surname full="yes">Allison</surname></persName> follows them, because he thinks it detracts from the fame of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00302" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0" authname="napoleon"><surname full="yes">Napoleon</surname></persName>, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00303" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0" authname="napoleon"><surname full="yes">Napoleon</surname></persName> himself, Savary, and <persName n="Thiers,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00304" reg="mostcommon:Thiers,nomatch:0" authname="thiers"><surname full="yes">Thiers</surname></persName>, as sort the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347" />The battle was fought under the expectation that Dessix would arrive in time to decide it, and be did so. So it was at <placeName reg="Austerlitz, Bourbon, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037561" authname="tgn,2037561">Austerlitz</placeName>, where the country was all cleared, and nothing existed to break a charge of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348" />The far famed "heights of Pretzer" are very moderate hills, the country back of them being a clear plateau, as level as a bowling green.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349" />Where the main charge was made, on the right of the allied line, upon the retreating forces of Bagration, the hills terminate in low grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350" />On the left of the allied line the <name>Holdback</name>, after soaking its way through the country for some distance, terminates in some ponds — a proof that the country is low or flat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351" />Such is the nature of the country also on the banks of the <name>Seals</name>, where the battle of <placeName reg="Jena, Loudon, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099764" authname="tgn,2099764">Jena</placeName> was fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352" />It rises into bluffs at the river, and spreads back in a plateau.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353" />It was on this plateau that <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00305" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0" authname="murat"><surname full="yes">Murat</surname></persName> made his famous charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354" />So it is at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Monroe, Illinois" key="tgn,2030592" authname="tgn,2030592">Waterloo</placeName>; the country is almost a dead level, or undulates so slightly as not to disturb a regiment of cavalry in the most headlong charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355" />It is also perfectly open, there being no woods which an American would think worthy of the name anywhere in the neighborhood, except the <rs>Forest</rs> of Solquies, which on the day of the battle was in the rear of the <rs>English</rs> position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356" /> All these things are to be considered in looking for examples to justify an increase of our cavalry forge, which is a very expensive arm of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357" />Now, our country is the very reverse of any over which any of these campaigns were prosecuted.--It is broken, hilly, full of gullies and ravines, and everywhere covered with wood, in an almost equal proportion to the cleared land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358" />We have heard cavalry officers any that there was nowhere here for cavalry to be employed on a grand scale in deciding a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359" />A routed chyme, pursued by cavalry, finds trinkets and guides always close at hand, where he can rally and resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360" />At <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933" authname="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>, for instance, if we could have thrown a heavy body of cavalry on <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00306" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0" authname="mcclellan"><surname full="yes">McClellan</surname></persName>'s defeated army, his destruction would have been complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361" />But it would have been impossible for horsemen to get through the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362" />And so it has been, we understand, in the case of nearly every battle we have fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363" />If the enemy, when compelled to turn his back, could have been charged by a strong cavalry force he would have been utterly routed; <unclear /> the nature of the country, fully as much as any <unclear /> in cavalry, has always forbidden it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364" /> Another great obstacle to our success has been the small numbers with which we have always been compelled to fight the gigantic <unclear /> of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365" />If our armies bore any proportion to their <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> in number, we should be better able to follow up our successes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366" />But we are usually no few in number, that our men are too much wearied at the end of a battle to make a hot pursuit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367" /> We have thought it important to examine the examples introduced by our contemporary to show that the circumstances of the coverall <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe," authname="tgn,1000003">European</placeName> cases are different from ours, and therefore not applicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368" />We may, however, be mistaken in the conclusions we would draw, although the premises be correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369" />If so, we shall be happy to be corrected. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
