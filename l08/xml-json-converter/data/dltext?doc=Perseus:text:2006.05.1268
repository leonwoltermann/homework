<head rend="italics">The right Man in the right place.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" /> History abounds with proof of the vital importance to a cause of having the right man in the right place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />It makes just as great a difference in every department of national affairs as it does in those of an individual what kind of head is upon its shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />No matter what the resources, what the courage of a people, all must prove unavailing unless, in the control of its finances and its armies, the right man is in the right place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" /> This truth was strikingly exemplified in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> not long before, and during, the <rs>French Revolution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />When the great financier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" /><persName><foreName full="yes">Neckar</foreName></persName>, assumed the control of the finances of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, the <rs>Government</rs> was most severely pressed by the money derangement; all was confusion, discord, darkness, mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />The influence of a master mind produced the most extraordinary change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />It was like the rising of the sun dissipating the shades of night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />In <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, <persName><foreName full="yes">Neckar</foreName></persName> changed a deficit of <num value="35000000">thirty-five millions</num> of francs into a surplus of <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> without imposing a single new tax of any kind, and under all the burdensome expenses which had been added to those of the former peace establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />But he was unfettered by any other department, and was clothed with full power to do whatever his own judgment dictated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />His resignation of office was a signal for the return of all the confusion and is order which had preceded his administration, and which finally led to the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />When he was again called to the direction of affairs, it was, in his own mournful words, "too late." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" /> <persName n="Carnot,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Carnot,nomatch:0" authname="carnot"><surname full="yes">Carnot</surname></persName> is another memorable example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />When he undertook the military administration of the <rs>Republic</rs> the crisis was truly appalling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />The Republic seemed ready to drop an unresisting prey into the hands of a hostile world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />But behold what the genius and energy of <num value="1">one</num> man, in the right place, can accomplish!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />In a brief space of time the whole scene was changed; the invading armies driven back at all points, and the anticipated victim of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> became its terrible conqueror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />In a year and <num value="0.5">a half</num> of <persName n="Carnot,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Carnot,nomatch:0" authname="carnot"><surname full="yes">Carnot</surname></persName>'s military administration, <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> victories, <num value="8">eight</num> of them in pitched battles, were gained; <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> successful actions; <num value="116">one hundred and sixteen</num> regular fortresses or great towns taken, and <num value="230">two hundred and thirty</num> lesser forts carried; <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num> of the enemy slain, <num value="91000">ninety-one thousand</num> made prisoners, <num value="3800">three thousand eight hundred</num> cannon and <num value="70000">seventy thousand</num> muskets captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />He discovered the merits of the illustrious <rs>Hoche</rs> when <persName n="Hoche,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hoche,nomatch:0" authname="hoche"><surname full="yes">Hoche</surname></persName> was only a sergeant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />The destinies of nations and of men depend upon the right man being in the right place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />It was supposed, however, that he had returned to the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.--it was not known at <placeName reg="Beaufort, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2073632" authname="tgn,2073632">Beaufort</placeName>, even by the highest officers, whether the expedition would return to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia" authname="tgn,7013920">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, or renew the attack upon <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina" authname="tgn,6002050">Fort Fisher</placeName>, or make a descent upon some other point on the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />It is hardly probable that another attempt will be made against the defences of this harbor, at least for some time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />Even if fresh operations be decided upon, it will require time to refit and patch up and get ready the necessary supplies of food and ammunition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" /> We know not to what extent the vessels of the armada were damaged; but it is not believed here that many of them were so much disabled that they cannot be repaired for future use. They fired at long range, as I learn from <persName n="Lamb,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lamb,nomatch:0" authname="lamb"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Colonel</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lamb</surname></persName>--the monitors about <measure n="1800yards" type="distance">eighteen hundred yards</measure> and the wooden hulls about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>. <num value="2">Two</num> <persName n="Brooke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Brooke,nomatch:0" authname="brooke"><surname full="yes">Brooke</surname></persName> guns, upon which much reliance was placed, burst after a few discharges; and the <rs>Armstrong</rs> gun, a magnificent piece, occupied a position on the sea face where it could not be brought to bear upon the enemy except at long intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />It was fired <num value="3">three</num> times — on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day, I believe — at <num value="3">three</num> wooden vessels, and at each discharge a vessel was seen to withdraw from the conflict.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" /> I do not know that it has been stated in any of my former letters that <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina" authname="tgn,6002050">Fort Fisher</placeName>, or rather the defences of the <rs type="place">New inlet</rs> or eastern entrance to the harbor of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631" authname="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, consists of <num value="2">two</num> lines of detached batteries nearly at right angles to each other, bearing the <num value="1">one</num> on the bar and channels, and the other on the land approach — the latter a formidable curtain, extending from the sea beach across to the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />Nowhere except at <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> places are there <num value="2">two</num> guns together, but each gun is separated from its neighbor by a traverse both on the right and the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />The traverses are <measure n="60feet" type="distance">sixty feet</measure> long, <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> wide at the base, and about <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" />The number and size of the traverses furnish the key to the very small loss sustained by the garrison and the small number of guns dismounted by the enemy's fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48" />Indeed, the protection afforded by the traverses against an enfilading fire from the sea is perfect, as was shown on both days of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49" />There are other features of the fort I should be glad to mention, if it were prudent, which add greatly to the safety and efficiency of the garrison. </p>
