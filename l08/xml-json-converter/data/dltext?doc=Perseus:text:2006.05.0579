<head>The greatest iron-clad ram in the world.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635" /> The <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, is giving an account of the iron-clad vessels of war now building, speaks as follows of the great ram now being built by <persName n="Webb,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00408" reg="mostcommon:Webb,nomatch:0" authname="webb"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Webb</surname></persName>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636" /> This vessel will be <num value="1">one</num> of the most extraordinary iron-clads in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637" />Larger than the <rs>Dictator</rs> and <rs>Puritan</rs>, she will be almost twice as heavy as either of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638" />She is over <measure n="40feet" type="distance">forty feet</measure> longer than any wooden ship afloat except the <rs>Great Eastern</rs>, and <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> longer than either of <persName n="Ericsson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00409" reg="mostcommon:Ericsson,nomatch:0" authname="ericsson"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Ericsson</surname></persName>'s <num value="2">two</num> largest vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639" />She will measure <num value="7000">7,000</num> tons, being more than the combined tonnage of the <name n="United Kingdom">English</name> <term type="ship">ships</term> <rs type="ship">Duke of Wellington</rs> and <rs type="ship">Marlborough</rs>, or of the <name n="United States">American</name> ships the <rs>Niagara</rs> and <rs>Roanoke</rs>, <num value="4">four</num> of the largest wooden vessels in the world,--Her dimensions are — length <measure n="360feet" type="distance">360 feet</measure>, breadth <measure n="78feet" type="distance">78 feet</measure>, depth <measure n="25feet" type="distance">25 feet</measure>, power of engines <num value="5000">5,000</num> horses, tonnage <num value="7000">7,000</num> tons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640" />Her beam, as will be seen, is greater by far than that of any other iron-clad vessels now building in this country or in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>.--None of them are over <num value="65">65</num> or <measure n="70feet" type="distance">70 feet</measure> wide, the <rs>La Gloire</rs> or Warrior not being even as wide as that. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641" /> <persName n="Webb,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00410" reg="mostcommon:Webb,nomatch:0" authname="webb"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Webb</surname></persName>'s vessel will be a steam screw propeller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642" />The bull will be of wood, and will consist of almost <num value="2">two</num> complete ships, <num value="1">one</num> to be built within the other, so that it might almost be said that you could completely destroy the outside vessels without inflicting a particle of injury upon the inside <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643" />In other words, it is a double vessel--<num value="1">one</num> within the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644" />Besides the thickness of the planking, and the bolts and screws, and other iron appendages of common vessels, together with those of the iron clad, with the additional protection of the <q direct="unspecified"> "<num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> ship,"</q> there will be a mall of <measure n="4.5inches" type="distance">4½ inches</measure> of iron covering the monster from stem to stern, making it almost impossible for any common ball to penetrate her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645" /> The <q direct="unspecified">"inner vessel"</q> will be divided into several compartments, both longitudinally and transversely, within which are enclosed both engines and boilers, thus securing the machinery beyond the possibility of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646" />But to render them still more safe both the engines and boilers are to be covered with a casemate, in which will be mounted a powerful battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647" />We are not permitted to give details of the armament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648" />Suffice it to say, however, that inside this casemate will certainly be placed guns which, for size and power, cannot be surpassed in any navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649" />Upon the casemate will rest <num value="2">two</num> revolving turrets, on <persName n="Ericsson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00411" reg="mostcommon:Ericsson,nomatch:0" authname="ericsson"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Ericsson</surname></persName>'s plan, each containing <num value="2">two</num> very large guns, the casting of which has already commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650" />The vessel will, therefore, have the advantage of being able to deliver a broadside, and at the same time to send a terrible discharge from the <num value="4">four</num> guns in the turrets in any direction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651" /> The great objection to iron-clad vessels, and <num value="1">one</num> which has been found in battle — as the case of the <rs>Monitor</rs> and <rs>Merrimac</rs> proves to be exceedingly dangerous to life — is the want of accommodation, not to speak of comfort, for men during an engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652" />In the new ram these inconveniences will be obviated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653" />By a singular and very scientific arrangement, <persName n="Webb,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00412" reg="mostcommon:Webb,nomatch:0" authname="webb"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Webb</surname></persName> has been enabled to preserve all the advantages of the iron-clad vessel, and still to make her roomy, comfortable, well ventilated, and in every respect as convenient below decks as a wooden man-of-war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654" /> Nor will this tremendous ship be a mere hulk lying in the neighborhood of the land alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655" />She will be a sea-going vessel in every respect, furnished with sails the same as the <rs>Niagara</rs> or <rs>Roanoke</rs>, and will be able to accommodate, besides the fighting crew of artillerists, a large force of naval sailors, for whom there will be plenty of room, and every accommodation for provisions and all necessaries for a long voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656" />Her keel will be laid in a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657" />Her keel blocks are now being put down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658" />Her name has not yet been decided upon. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
