<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />All, in the language of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, was painfully quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />Since, there has been quite a formidable advance of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />At a very early hour on last <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the <dateStruct value="--13" full="yes" authname="---13"><day reg="13" full="yes">13th inst.</day></dateStruct>, your correspondent was informed that the <rs>Yankees</rs> were crossing at <placeName reg="Rixey ford">Rixey</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kelly's Ford, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2112479" authname="tgn,2112479">Kelly's fords</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />Soon after intelligence came that they were crossing at all the fordable points on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> between the <num value="2">two</num> fords mentioned above.--<persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0" authname="stuart"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Stuart</surname></persName>, with his usual vigilance, had not allowed himself to be surprised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />Through his scouts and other sources he had been apprised of the enemy's making preparations to cross the river, and sent orders to officers commanding the different brigades to hold themselves in readiness to meet the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />Soon bugles of the various regiments were sounded, and the men sprang into their saddles promptly and dashed off to meet him.--A very heavy column of cavalry, accompanied by several batteries, had crossed the river at <persName n="Kelly,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Kelly,nomatch:0" authname="kelly"><surname full="yes">Kelly</surname></persName>'s, and was marching cautiously on the road leading from this ford to Brandy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" />They had met with very little resistance until they reached this point, having no force to contend with save that of pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48" />Here the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 6">6th</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 12">12th regiments</orgName> skirmished with them for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51" />Another engagement immediately ensued, in which the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num> and <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> participated largely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52" />Both fought splendidly; the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num> has long since won a glorious name for prowess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53" />But with all the valor evinced, the overwhelming column of the enemy could not be checked, our cavalry retiring slowly until it reached <placeName reg="Mountain Run, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,2528029" authname="tgn,2528029">Mountain Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54" />Here a squadron of the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> made a bold charge and drove the enemy back a short distance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55" /> It was here we lost <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery that had been placed in position to hold a ford below the railroad bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56" />The regiment that had been placed in supporting distance of this artillery changed its position through a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57" />A portion of the enemy's cavalry swept around, under cover of a hill and out of view, until they got within a very short distance, when they charged and took it. About the same time another gun was captured by a very rapid flank movement on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58" />While I regret to record the loss of these guns, I do not believe it could have been avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279" />The <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs> urges that every man not liable to conscription, able to bear arms without respect to age be enrolled, "if not for active service, at least for protection and defence at home." He urges that in this organization company officers alone be elected by the members, and that the <rs>Governor</rs> be authorized to appoint the field officers — that there be a re-examination of exemptions, many of which have been improperly granted — that the forces organized should not be limited to cities and towns where organized, but should be required to go wherever required in cases of sudden emergency within the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283" />Can there be any wrong in calling upon him, who, through his pecuniary advantages is sheltered in the bosom of his family, to defend his own home and the homes of the poorer class, who, in constant peril of life and limb, are fighting the common enemy at a distance? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285" />Persons have undertaken to raise companies ostensibly for the active volunteer force, but really for the pecuniary benefit derivable from this most discreditable business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286" />Men enrolled their names in these companies only for the purpose of escaping service by getting in substitutes, who deserted as soon as they were mustered into service, and played the same game over again as often as they had a chance to do so.
