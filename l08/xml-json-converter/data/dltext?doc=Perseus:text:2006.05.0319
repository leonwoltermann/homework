<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" /> --The season for active military operations has so nearly closed that we can now estimate the results of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year's struggle between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />If we take as the standard of comparison what the aggressive section proposed at the outset and have endeavored to accomplish, the case is clear that its campaign has been a complete failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />The <rs>North</rs> was to have overrun the <rs>South</rs> in <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>; it was to have taken <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580" authname="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, New Orleans, and a dozen other cities; and its armies were to have wintered in our seats of wealth, luxury, and fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />In no part of this brilliant and luxurious programme have they succeeded. --They have not a single city of any size in the <rs>South</rs>; nor do they hold a single county of the whole Confederacy in undisturbed possession, except where the inhabitants themselves, by their own disloyal agency, secured them possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />It is a remarkable fact, developed at the close of a campaign in which the <rs>North</rs> have put forth its most strenuous exertions, that they hold no portion of the <rs>Southern</rs> territory except such as was virtually surrendered to them by disloyal Southern people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />In every other respect, but in reference to this striking fact, the campaign has been a complete failure.--Whenever they have attempted to penetrate our country in force, they have been driven back with ruin and slaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />Nowhere, where the people have in mass opposed them, have they been able to establish themselves upon a firm footing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" /> This great fact cannot fail to have its proper effect upon the public opinion of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" /><num value="400000000">Four hundred millions</num> of dollars have been expended; from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> troops brought into the field; <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> of strenuous campaigning has been performed; and the grand result is, the possession of <num value="0.5">a half</num>-Yankee fled and exposed portion of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; of a part of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255" authname="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> voluntarily surrendered to them by the treachery of a act of disgraced politicians and timid property holders; and of those regions of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523" authname="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> where the <q direct="unspecified">"Union"</q> sentiment was strong enough to prevent the military organization of the true Southern people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />They have conquered nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />They hold no part of our soil, except that which our people surrendered into their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />They have won no victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />They have gained no glory or renown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />They came into the war, proud of their strength, and confident of their prowess, expecting to frighten us by their mere approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />They go out of the campaign smarting under repeated defeats, the laughing-stock of the world, and feeling in their hearts their utter inferiority to us in all the qualities of warriors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" /> The worst spent <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> that ever slipped out of a public treasury, have been the <num value="1000000">millions</num> which the <rs>North</rs> has paid for <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> of campaigning, which has resulted in nothing but in teaching them that their volunteers are cowards, and cannot be trusted in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />It reminds us of the vast pains and expense which <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0" authname="xerxes"><surname full="yes">Xerxes</surname></persName>, <persName><foreName full="yes">Darius</foreName></persName>, and those Eastern commanders of myriads, were at, to learn experimentally the same sad truth of their armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />A nation may have wealth in its exchequer, arms in its arsenals, supplies in unbounded profusion, and it may have troops by the <num value="1000000">million</num>, and yet, unless those men have the true pluck of warriors, and be capable of fighting bravely in the field, these grand appurtenances of military power are butas sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />They can effect no more in the field, against brave men, than a Chinese army with a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> gongs against a brigade of <name>British</name> regulars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" /> The <rs>North</rs> have brought a vast concourse of men into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />They have expended an ocean of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />They have planned stupendous campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />They proposed to accomplish long triumphant marches; to utterly subjugate <num value="11">eleven</num> sovereign States; to take possession of wealthy and luxuriant cities; to apportion vast landed properties among their troops; to set several <num value="1000000">millions</num> of negroes free and to establish the <rs>Federal Government</rs> throughout the old Union in such impregnable strength, that nothing could shake it, and none dispute its supremacy, forever more.--They proposed to do all this in a very few months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />A man in their midst who had hinted a doubt of its accomplishment in less than <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> from the date of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:2" authname="lincoln,abraham"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>'s call for <num value="73">seventy-three</num> regiments, would have been instantly bastiled in <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />But nothing of all this splendid programme has been accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />Their money is gone, the prestige of their troops lost, and footing is obtained nowhere in the <rs>South</rs>, except where treachery and deception have accomplished for them what their valor could not. Nay, they have lost ground; for whereas they felt secure of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255" authname="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, that State, after hard fighting, is sure now to be ours; and whereas they thought they had effectually overrun <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523" authname="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, they find the indomitable spirit of that people unconquerable, and that they have suffered their severest reverses in the very State which they thought most surely their own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" /> The South, on the other hand, commenced the campaign, proposing nothing but self defence; and that defence she has successfully made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />At the outset of a war for which she was not prepared, and which she did not expect, she was incapable of undertaking offensive warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />She planted herself upon the defensive; and she has succeeded in whipping the <rs>North</rs> and baffling all their grand designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />She has inspired her soldiers with the prestige of victory, and will, in another campaign, be ready to avail herself of this prestige, and of her more perfect state of preparation, to make her adversaries feel her power with a vengeance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" />They are already aware that we are their masters; and in another campaign we will assert that character upon them with a strong hand. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414" /> The telegraph brings intelligence of a great battle in the <rs>West</rs>, in which the enemy, in vastly superior numbers, was defeated and driven back with immense slaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415" /><placeName reg="Belmont, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013377" authname="tgn,7013377">Belmont</placeName>, the locality of this battle, is in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523" authname="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, opposite the town of <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271" authname="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, Ky.--To prevent operations against our batteries at the latter place, a small force of <num value="2500">2,500</num> men was stationed across the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231" authname="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Belmont, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013377" authname="tgn,7013377">Belmont</placeName>, and it appears that the purpose of the enemy was to drive them from the position and occupy it, by which a strategic point of no small importance would have been gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416" />The Federal force therefore started from <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995" authname="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> in gun-boats and transports, and approached to a point <placeName><distance reg="7miles" full="yes" exact="U">seven miles</distance> above <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271" authname="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName></placeName>, where a bend in the river afforded an opportunity for a stealthy landing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419" />The Federals were completely routed, and pursued back to their boats, while the road for a distance of <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> was strewn with the evidences of rapid flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420" />This victory is important, not only from the moral effect of such an event, but in the complete over throw of the enemy's plans of opening a passage down the river towards <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750" authname="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442" />It is caused by a cold and chill upon an exhausted or wearied body, and leaves the system so enfeebled as to require weeks, sometimes months, to recover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443" />Another kind of fever is produced by over-crowded and unhealthy tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444" />If a company have a scarcity of tents there is the greater reason for airing those they have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445" />Persons are seldom injured by <hi rend="italics">too much pure air.</hi> If a number of men are compelled to sleep in <num value="1">one</num> tent, it should not be closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446" />It is when the lungs are weakened, and the blood impoverished by breathing impure air, that the body is most liable to disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447" />It may be observed, at our more stationary encampments, that those companies who are most careful to keep their tents clean, and the neighborhood free from impurities, have been the least subject to disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448" />Those who are compelled to roll up their tents at sunrise and leave the interior exposed to the sun's rays and the purifying breeze till sunset, and who once in every week take them down, and subject every article to a regular <name>Saturday</name>'s cleaning, while no refuse or impurity is allowed to be thrown within a certain distance of the camp, are seen to be the most robust and healthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449" />The tents should not be left standing many days in the same spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450" />Their whole width moved forward or backward every week could not interfere seriously with the arrangement of the regiment, and would materially preserve the health of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451" />Another danger is in neglecting the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> symptoms of camp fever; because <q direct="unspecified">"it is only a cold"</q> in its on set, the patient is allowed to remain in his tent, infecting the air his comrades breathe, while the disease is taking root, perhaps past remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452" />The doctors assure us that it is highly important that this kind should be treated immediately, when it could be more easily checked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453" /> An immense responsibility rests with our officers in regard to these things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454" />They are able to keep off a vast amount of sickness by enforcing camp regulations, and not permitting their men to wait till too late before they are taken to the hospitals; also by exercising a watchfulness and kindly influence over them to induce prudence on their own part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455" />Each season will bring its maladies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456" />It is not because the hot season is over that we can expect to be free from fevers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457" />If such a scourge as small-pox were to creep into our army, and from thence into all the towns and villages where our soldiers are now being nursed, what greater calamity could happen to our country under present circumstances? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458" /> Every soldier who has not been vaccinated within <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> should use the prevention of having it done immediately.
