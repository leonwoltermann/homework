<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9" /> The people of the <rs>South</rs>, who know the <rs>Yankees</rs> well, and perfectly understand the men who now guide their affairs, know that neither they nor their Government will ever make reparation, apology, or atonement, when the demand for either is not backed by the power to enforce it. Does any man with sense enough to keep out of the fire believe that <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0" authname="mason"><surname full="yes">Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0" authname="slidell"><surname full="yes">Slidell</surname></persName> would have been surrendered to a demand from <placeName reg="Mexico" key="tgn,1001893" authname="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> or <placeName reg="Portugal" key="tgn,1000090" authname="tgn,1000090">Portugal</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Danmark" key="tgn,1000066" authname="tgn,1000066">Denmark</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" />Would the tiger voluntarily surrender the fawn?--or the hyena his exhumed food?--or the anaconda the victim within his folds?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />Neither would the <rs>Yankee</rs> restore anything ill gotten, or atone for any outrage unless coerced to do so by a force superior to any he can exert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />Very naturally be becomes the lasting enemy of any who may extort restitution or amendment from him. He cannot brook the deprivation of his gratifications either of his malice or his selfishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" />Therefore when the <rs>Yankee Government</rs> gave up <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0" authname="mason"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Messrs.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0" authname="slidell"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes" /><surname full="yes">Slidell</surname></persName>--whose fates it had prefigured and gloated over with a brutal satisfaction like that enjoyed by the <name>Cyclop</name> over the victims in his cave — it gave them up with smothered wrath and in ward promises of revenge upon the power that demanded them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" /> From that day the <rs>Government</rs> and the people of the <rs>North</rs> have been storing up wrath for the <rs>English</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />What boots it that they are permitted without restriction to obtain in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> everything they desire — arms, ammunition, and all the materials of war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />What matters it that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> time and again protests her neutrality and submits her vessels to the terms of a Yankee blockade which is not in the law <rs>England</rs> herself has set up, a legal <num value="1">one</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />She gets no credit for her professions, and her respect of the blockade is attributed to fear of the <rs>Yankees</rs> on the sea. If the <rs>Confederates</rs> get a gun from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> by all the dangers of the blockade, it is added to the account against the <rs>British</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />If our Government buys up an old boat from an Englishman and mans her with brave men to fret and damage the commerce of the <rs>Yankees</rs>, it is entered in their anti <name>British</name> memorabilia as a grievance that nothing short of the overthrow of the <rs>British Government</rs> will atone for!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />In short ever since the war they have been storing up malice against the <rs>English</rs> for a future day. Their press and their public men are continually muttering the thunders of this prospective storm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" /> We have man indirect way — via <placeName reg="Hamilton, Butler, Ohio" key="tgn,7015730" authname="tgn,7015730">Hamilton</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda" authname="tgn,7005064">Bermuda</placeName> — received an article on this subject copied from <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Harpers Weekly" type="magazine">Harper's Weekly</orgName>,</hi> a well known exponent of Northern sentiment, most extensively sustained and read by Northern people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />It expresses more exactly the views and policy of the <rs>Yankees</rs> in their relations with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> than any article we have seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />We invite attention to it: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" /> There has never been a time when hatred of the <rs>English</rs> was so deep or so wide spread as it is at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />There has never been a period at which war with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> could have been more generally welcomed than at present — if we were free to engage in a foreign war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" /> Yet we do not believe that war imminent.--We cannot afford the luxury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />The struggle in which we are engaged taxes all our resources, and to carry it safely through to a successful issue will require our undivided energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />For this reason we do not anticipate that our Government will declare war against <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> — though it has ample ground for doing so; or will even declare an embargo, or seize <name>British</name> property to recompense our ship owners for the losses they are suffering through the piratical acts of <name>British</name> vessels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" /> Our <num value="1">one</num> just now is to suffer everything from foreigners for the sake of concentrating our whole force on the suppression of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />When this is done, we shall have time to devote to our foreign enemies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" /> So soon as the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> has been achieved, we look to see energetic measures adopted by the <rs>Government</rs> for the settlement of accounts with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />We expect to see every man who has lost a dollar by the depredations of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659" authname="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> paid in full, with interest, by the <rs>British Government</rs>.--The amount can always be collected in the port of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />Half a dozen <name>British</name> steamers and a score of <name>British</name> ships seized and aid at auction by the <orgName n="U. S. Marshal" type="org">United States Marshal</orgName> would go far to make a balance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />And when <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> next goes to war let her look out for retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />Though her antagonist be only some Hottentot chief, the ocean shall bristle with American cruisers bearing his flag, and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> may rely on it, that for every peaceful American trader that has been burned during this war by <name>British</name> pirates, <num value="10">ten</num> <name>British</name> vessels will then be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />The next war in which <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> engages will be the end of her foreign commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" />We mistake our countrymen greatly, if, at the end of <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>, they leave a ship bearing the <rs>British</rs> flag afloat in any sea from the <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7015931" authname="tgn,7015931">German Ocean</placeName> to <placeName reg="Behring's Straits">Behring's Straits</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" /> We do not suppose that these terrible threats — these promised revenges postponed to a <hi rend="italics">convenient season</hi>--will disturb the equanimity of <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Bull,John,,," authname="bull,john"><foreName full="yes">John</foreName> <surname full="yes">Bull</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />He is not easily disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />He, too, has interests which sometimes induce him to smother as well as postpone wrath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />He will likely, influenced by this policy, continue to be neutral — continue to flout Southerners, set watches upon their agents, and increase the difficulties of their intercourse with their friends abroad, and also continue his explanations and protestations of neutrality to the <rs>Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />In the matter of <name>Yankee</name> revenge <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Bull,John,,," authname="bull,john"><foreName full="yes">John</foreName> <surname full="yes">Bull</surname></persName> may rest assured that it will be indulged economically and profitably.--<persName n="Harper,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Harper,nomatch:0" authname="harper"><surname full="yes">Harper</surname></persName>'s foreshadowed piratical co-operation with the "Hottentot Chief" presents the war of the <rs>Yankees</rs> on <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> in a form altogether agreeable to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />It is the general robbery and spoil of a very rich commerce which would pay very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />So let the <rs>British</rs> look out!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />If they get into trouble with a Hottentot they had better, in advance, buy up his brother barbarians of the <rs>North</rs> by paying them all their losses by Alabamas and Floridas, and add enough of gold to heal their wounded honor and appease their indignant and virtuous wrath before they proclaim war with their immediate antagonist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />If they do not, they will be universally robbed and pillaged until they will be commercially and financially ruined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />If <persName n="Bull,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Bull,John,,," authname="bull,john"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Bull</surname></persName> knows the value of a bribe, he could never employ <num value="1">one</num> more profitably than in such a case with the <rs>Yankees</rs>. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"> 
<head>Starvation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" /> The <rs>Yankees</rs>, who have tried all their <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> and failed, are now trusting to the co-operation of <persName n="Starvation,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Starvation,nomatch:0" authname="starvation"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Starvation</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54" />It is instructive to the world to know that much more of it. </p>
