<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" /> Some of the <rs>Northern</rs> journals profess to look with more toleration upon certain Southern States than others.--They do not place <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709" authname="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> in the same category with the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />They are pleased to remark that these States were among the last that came into the contest, and that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> had often interposed her influence under the old Government to prevent collisions like the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />They single out <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712" authname="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> as the ring leader of this riot — an old offender, who had long been seeking to make mischief in the happy family. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" /> We shall not stop to show that the original disunion State of the old Confederacy was <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517" authname="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />She was in favor of disunion so long ago as the last war. Her Legislature passed secession resolutions as late as the annexation of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826" authname="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />It was in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517" authname="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, long before Southern Secession, that the compact of the <rs>Union</rs> was openly declared "a compact with Hell." Practical nullification existed in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203" authname="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> long before Southern Secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />The restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> is the last thing that, even now, <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203" authname="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> desires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />It spits upon the idea of any renewal of that alliance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" /> We, too, on our part, can make a discrimination among our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />Badly as the <rs>North</rs> has behaved in general, we recognize, without difficulty, the motive influence of the war in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203" authname="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> <persName><foreName full="yes">Puritanism</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />It was the ascendancy of its turbulent and ferocious spirit in the councils of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> which precipitated this war, and which has imparted to it its peculiar horrors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />The motives of the <rs>Middle States</rs> and the <rs>Western</rs> are an entirely different kind of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />Even the <rs>Masonic Lodges</rs> of the <rs>South</rs> are not recognized by the same order in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203" authname="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />A <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203" authname="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> General in the <rs>South</rs> lately destroyed Masonic property and refused to make any reparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" /><placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203" authname="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> demands subjugation.--Nay more, its clergy clamor for extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" /><placeName reg="The Boston">The Boston</placeName> <hi rend="italics">Recorder,</hi> a leading religious paper, edited by clergymen, and enjoying a large circulation, alludes to the danger to which the "loyal" North is exposed "from selfish desires for peace" and from being "too ready to take the <name>Divine</name> prerogative of forgiveness into our own hands, as if we were more merciful than <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and pardon those dreadful offenders whom the <rs>Lord</rs>, in mercy to posterity, has delivered to us to destroy."

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />This the <rs>Recorder</rs> regards as a case in point, illustrating the dreadful iniquity of permitting any human being in the <rs>South</rs> to live and breathe. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />This horrible perversion and distortion of the <name>Scripture</name>, to justify the most abominable crimes, was always characteristic of Puritans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />When you tell them that the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> sanctions slavery, they scornfully reply,--falsely, of course,--that this was only under the Old Dispensation, adapted to the infamy of a barbarous nation, but that the <name>Gospel</name> has introduced a new law,--"Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you." But when they want a pretext for the indulgence of the most vindictive and ferocious passions, they arrogate to themselves the attributes of the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Justice, punishing, under the Old Dispensation, all indulgence to idolaters and criminals, and conveniently forget the "Do unto others," etc., of the <name>Gospel</name> — that Gospel which proclaims,--"A new commandment, I give unto you, that ye love <num value="1">one</num> another." </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" /> A contemporary speaks of an idea said to be entertained by some persons, that it would be a good thing to make proposals to the <name>Governments</name> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> to sell out the whole Confederate establishment, "lock, stock and barrel," together with its interest in national independence and in the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, as the <hi rend="italics">dernier resort</hi> against Federal subjugation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" /> It is altogether too early in the day to consider such a proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />The Confederacy is not yet exactly in the situation of "Japheth in search of a Father." When that time has come, we can have an auctioneer's block raised in the <rs type="place">Capitol Square</rs>,--perhaps the <rs>Washington Monument</rs> would answer the purpose,--and some gentleman experienced in disposing of "most elegant and desirable property, ancient family mansions, fine orchards, never-failing springs," etc., employed to do the "Going — going — gone." The live stock, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs>, to go with the estate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />Specimens of these, including the various public functionaries, civil and military, portly country gentlemen, and members of the <rs type="place">City</rs> Councils, men of all estates and all colors, should be congregated about the auctioneer, to enable the bidders to make a personal inspection.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71" /> Double skirts are often seen, either for visiting, dinner or ball dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72" />If closed all round, they are generally looped up; if open, the openings are at the back, as well as at the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73" />In many cases these skirts are made of different colors and materials, such as moire or satin over velvet, or <num value="2">two</num> shades of the same color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74" />This fashion of wearing double skirts is much adopted for ball dresses, the underskirt generally being white and the tunic of color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75" />The low body, with coat hasques, will be much worn if <milestone unit="column" n="5" /> the dress is of silk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78" />This, if made in white plush, with a thick Hama or chenille fringe, is very elegant and suitable to the seasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79" />Many opera cloaks that we have seen were of scarlet, trimmed with black lace, or embroidered in <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> floss silks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80" />The little hoods, now worn over the <rs n="head dress" type="product">head-dress</rs> during the transit to and from the carriage, are very pretty, and in many cases becoming. --We give the preference to the <rs>Marie Stuart</rs> shape, with a deep curtain falling over the shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117" />The body was of black tulle and satin, with ornaments of gold grapes on the shoulders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118" />The wide waistbands so much in favor a little while ago are rapidly disappearing, and giving place to those of a medium-size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119" />When the wide ones are used, they are mostly fastened at the back or sides with a rosette instead of a buckle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120" />The sashes are still fastened in the same manner, and have very wide ends. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122" /><milestone unit="column" n="6" /> A deep lace was carried round the waist, and formed into the coat basque as the back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123" />This body was intended to be worn over a white satin dress, trimmed with black lace and pearls. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124" />There is no alteration in the form of cuffs and collars at present; they are still embroidered with <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">colored</rs> bees, butterflies, <hi rend="italics">flours de lis,</hi> etc. The most fashionable ornament at the present moment is in the shape of a swallow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125" /> Crests and initials are sometimes embroidered on cuffs and collars, as well as handkerchiefs, the latter being very handsome, though our <hi rend="italics">elegantes</hi> have at length understood that these articles are for the pocket, and so longer display them in the hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126" /> Small veils are much worn, and appear likely to continue in favor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127" /> We are very happy to see the decided return of necklaces; they are not confined to evening wear, but accompany morning toilets, though, of course, in a modified form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128" />The long chains of beads have become excessively vulgar; <num value="1">one</num> row close round the throat, with a medallion, is sometimes worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129" />But the most elegant of these collars are of plain ribbon velvet, fastened with a shape, and ornamented with <rs n="gold coin" type="product">gold coins</rs>, small sprays of steel-work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132" />We have seen several dresses of moire or light satin, made with these jackets, accompanied by the chemisette <rs>Russes</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133" />These, if intended to be worn with silk or dressy materials, are made of tulle, or very fine muslin, with lace insertions; or with trills of lace and open-work insertions, in which are cerise colored velvets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134" />Some are made of <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> lace, others entirely of <name>English</name> point.
