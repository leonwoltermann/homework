<milestone unit="sentence" n="82" />At an early hour this morning, when the fog had lifted from the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> below, it was discovered that the <rs>Federal</rs> commander was massing a heavy force on his left and opposite to our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83" />As the morning advanced this force grew denser and larger, until it covered all the slopes this side of Cemetery Fort, which is near the river above, and the last work the enemy has on his left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84" />At <time value="12mid">12 M.</time> these masses deployed into <num value="2">two</num> lines of battle, with heavy reserves.--This movement completed, the guns of the fort opened at <time value="2pm">2 P. M.</time>, when the heavy lines of the <rs>Federal</rs> advanced rapidly against our pickets, and drove them in after a sharp resistance on their part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85" />By <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> the enemy had gained <placeName key="possibilities=78" n="1.000 10" reg="," authname="possibilities=78">Indian Hill</placeName>, an eminence which stands about midway between Cemetery Fort and <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191" authname="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>, being between his <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> and our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86" />He advanced upon no other part of the lines, and rested after gaining possession of the hill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87" /> In the meantime <persName n="Robertson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0" authname="robertson"><roleName n="Major" full="yes">Major</roleName> <surname full="yes">Robertson</surname></persName> brought up a few guns of his <orgName n="Reserve Artillery" type="artillery">reserve artillery</orgName>, and with other batteries posted on <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191" authname="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName> to the right, opened upon the enemy — with what effect is not known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88" />We only know that he maintained his new position, notwithstanding our fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89" />No report has been received of our casualties beyond a surmise in official quarters, that they will reach from <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="200">two hundred</num> in killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90" />Only our pickets were engaged, the enemy not coming within range of our line of battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91" /> When this movement was going on it was observed that the enemy threw a considerable column up the river further to our right, as if he intended to overlap our line and compel us to stretch it out to a length that would render it very long and very weak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92" />Can it be that he means to threaten our depot of supplies at <placeName reg="Chickamauga Station, Chattanooga, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098422" authname="tgn,2098422">Chickamauga station</placeName>, and at the same time to draw us away from <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143" authname="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93" />The idea that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,," authname="grant,u.,s."><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName> desires to advance his lines in order to get more room and a further supply of firewood, as has been suggested, will not hear the test of reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94" />A movement on so large and imposing a scale looks to ulterior objects, and is intended to initiate operations upon a broad and comprehensive scale. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95" />The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> result of such a movement will be to compel <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0" authname="bragg"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Bragg</surname></persName> to weaken his forces on <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143" authname="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> (his left) to reinforce his right, which is comparatively weak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96" />Indeed, orders to this effect have already been given, and are now being executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97" />It will never do to let the enemy turn our right and get possession of our depot at <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598" authname="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99" />The demonstration to-day was intended, doubtless, to force him to make his election between the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100" />If he decide to hold <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598" authname="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName> then he must yield the mountain, and throw his army between the enemy's encroaching <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> and the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101" />If he give the preference to Lookout then the railroad and his depot of supplies must go. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102" />The natural effect of the affair to-day as has already been intimated, will be to force <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0" authname="bragg"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Bragg</surname></persName> to weaken his left in order to strengthen his <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>, now threatened by a formidable and largely superior force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103" />This, I doubt not, was <num value="1">one</num> of the objects of the demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104" />I look, therefore, for an assault upon Lookout to-morrow, when it will be less able to resist an attack than it was to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105" />Our artillery on the mountain will be of no assistance after the enemy shall have reached the foot of the mountain, it being impossible to depress the guns sufficiently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106" />The importance of the mountain ceased with the loss of <placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816" authname="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107" />The possession of the valley reduces the wagon transportation of the enemy to <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> at farthest, and gives him the use of the river besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108" />The voluntary abandonment of the mountain, therefore, should occasion no regret, since its longer retention is not only of slight importance, but will be attended with much difficulty on account of the great length of our line. </p> <closer> <signed>Sallust.</signed> </closer> </div3>

Having <milestone unit="column" n="3" /> accomplished a part of the object of his demonstration yesterday — to wit: the transfer of a portion of our forces on the mountain to the extreme right, he attacked the mountain with a confidence which the sequel will show was not misplaced.--The great rise in the <rs>Tennessee</rs> had carried away his pontoon bridges the night before, but his positions were so well taken, and had been so strongly fortified, that he did not hesitate to make the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110" />He opened at <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> with his batteries in <placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816" authname="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName>, directing his fire against our lines along the western side and northern face of the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111" />Our own batteries on the mountain could take no part in the engagement, owing to a dense fog which enveloped <placeName key="possibilities=46" n="1.000 10" reg="," authname="possibilities=46">Lookout Point</placeName> and the crest above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112" />At <time value="12:30">half-past 12</time> the <rs>Infantry</rs> became engaged, and the battle was then fully joined. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113" /> Very few details have been received — too few, indeed, for me to attempt to enter into particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114" />The impression prevails in well-informed circles that the affair has not been well conducted by the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers in command on the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115" />Our forces had been much weakened the night before by the withdrawal of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Walker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Walker,nomatch:0" authname="walker"><surname full="yes">Walker</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, which was sent to the right, leaving only <placeName key="tgn,2005379" n="1.000 91" reg="stevenson, jackson, alabama" authname="tgn,2005379">Stevenson</placeName>'s and <orgName n="divisions"><persName n="Cheatham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Cheatham,nomatch:0" authname="cheatham"><surname full="yes">Cheatham</surname></persName>'s divisions</orgName> behind, both under command of <persName n="Stevenson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,nomatch:0" authname="stevenson"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Stevenson</surname></persName>. <persName n="Cheatham,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Cheatham,nomatch:0" authname="cheatham"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Cheatham</surname></persName> arrived on the ground late in the afternoon, having just returned to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116" />Up to the time of his return his division was under the command of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0" authname="jackson"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Jackson</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Brigadier">senior brigadier</rs> in the division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117" />It was thought that these <num value="2">two</num> divisions would have been sufficient to hold the position against a largely-superior force; but not so. The Confederates were steadily pushed back from the moment the infantry opened fire until late in the evening, when <persName n="Breckinridge,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0" authname="breckinridge"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Breckinridge</surname></persName> went to the assistance of <persName n="Stevenson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,nomatch:0" authname="stevenson"><surname full="yes">Stevenson</surname></persName> with a brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118" />The Federal, who had driven the <rs>Confederates</rs> slowly around the north face of the mountain to <placeName reg="Craven's house">Craven's house</placeName>, and thence around almost to the road which leads to the top, were, in their turn, forced back after night some <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure>. The fight continued until <time value="10pm">10 P. M.</time>, and even now I can hear an occasional shot while I write. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119" /> The troops and guns on the mountain were brought down safely, only a few commissary stores being left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120" />We lost a considerable number of prisoners, nevertheless, early in the day and on the western slope of the mountain, the enemy, it is alleged, having got in the rear of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Walthall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00080" reg="mostcommon:Walthall,nomatch:0" authname="walthall"><surname full="yes">Walthall</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> under cover of the prevailing fog. <num value="1">One</num> account says that <persName n="Walthall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="mostcommon:Walthall,nomatch:0" authname="walthall"><surname full="yes">Walthall</surname></persName> lost from <num value="500">500</num> to <measure n="600" type="prisoners">600 prisoners</measure>, including nearly the whole of <num value="1">one</num> regiment, the <orgName type="regiment" key="MS34">34th Mississippi</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121" />It is not improbable that our loss has been exaggerated somewhat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122" /> Orders have been given to evacuate the mountain and for the whole army to retire across the <rs>Chickamauga</rs>, in the direction of the station of that name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123" />The loss of <placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816" authname="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName> and <placeName reg="Brown's Ferry">Brown's Ferry</placeName> removed all doubt as to the ability of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,," authname="grant,u.,s."><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen'l</roleName> <surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName> to subsist his army at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496" authname="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> this winter, and rendered the longer possession of <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143" authname="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> of comparatively little importance, and now that the mountain has passed into his hands there is no reason left why we should longer remain in the mud and water around <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496" authname="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126" />This movement greatly endangers the depot and railroad, and furnishes an additional reason for withdrawing across the <rs>Chickamauga</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435" />Officers from that quarter who were in this city <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> ago made no secret, so we learn, of the fact that it was <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0" authname="bragg"><surname full="yes">Bragg</surname></persName>'s intention to fall back on <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598" authname="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, and that he had even before they left camp commenced he contemplated retrograde movement, by sending all the heavy baggage, &amp;c., to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436" />The reason assigned is very simple, and very natural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437" /><persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0" authname="bragg"><surname full="yes">Bragg</surname></persName> wished to be nearer his depots of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438" />In his then position he was compelled to haul all his commissary and quartermaster stores from <num value="7">seven</num> to <measure n="9miles" type="distance">nine miles</measure>, over roads already rendered nearly impassable by the continual passage of heavy trains over them, and in a fair way to become absolutely so as soon as the inevitable mud began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439" />Moreover, he was desirous to concentrate his forces, which were widely dispersed, and therefore continually exposed to attack in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440" />It appears evident that he was in the act of executing this movement in retreat when he was attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441" />It was comparatively easy for the enemy to gain possession of <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143" authname="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> after so large a portion of the force which originally held it had been withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442" />The impression prevailed the other day that the centre had been routed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443" /> This dispirited our people more than anything else, for our troops had never before been routed in fair fight, although they had been sometimes compelled to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444" />It turns out, however, that it was only the "left centre" (that is, the extreme left of the centre) that had been routed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445" />This makes a very great difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446" />The centre, we understand, extended its left into a valley, between <num value="2">two</num> mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447" />The left of the centre, which was very feeble, was attacked by an overwhelming force, the design being to rout it, and turn the heights on which the rest of the centre was placed, thus compelling it to fall back, or surrounding it if it stood firm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448" />It had already commenced falling back before its extreme left was beaten, and the whole line kept pace with the retrograde movement, thus preventing the enemy from deriving the expected advantage from the interposition of heavy columns between the <num value="2">two</num> wings of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449" />The knowledge of this fact with regard to the left centre is calculated to remove much of the despondency which arose out of the belief that our centre had sustained a sort of <placeName reg="Waterloo, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,2005702" authname="tgn,2005702">Waterloo</placeName> rout. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466" />Starving, freezing, and every description of brutality, are employed to destroy the gallant men whom the fortune of war has thrown into their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467" />These unhappy victims of devilish hate are thus punished, not for invading another country, but for defending their own homes and firesides from an internal invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468" />Yet the monsters who perpetrate these unheard of crimes have the shameless impudence to shed crocodile tears over the imagined suffering of the <rs>Yankee</rs> prisoners in our hands, hoping thereby to divert the attention of the world from their own horrid cruelties, and to furnish a pretext for new atrocities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469" />If what they allege were true, it would be no more than invaders have a right to expect, nor half as much as the hideous oppressors of our own unfortunate captives deserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471" />But no <num value="1">one</num> knows better than these unprincipled savages that their stories of starvation and cruelty in Southern prisons are as false as their own false and perfidious natures, and that any inconveniences or privations they may suffer is all the fault of the arch-fiend <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>, who refuses to agree to a fair exchange of prisoners. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473" />There is no other way of punishing the wretches who commit such crimes, no other method of retaliation, no other way of escaping themselves from the fate of their brethren, than by making every battle a battle to the death, by preferring to lie down and die rather than go to a Northern prison, and by sacrificing till their arms are wearied with slaughter, as many victims to the manes of their countrymen, starved, sickened, and frozen to death in Northern prisons, as powder and bayonet can reach.
