<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" /> These notices are in pursuance of the plan of Congress for coercing the funding of notes of circulation issued by the <rs>Government</rs> to meet us expenditures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />Until recently those notes purporting upon their face to be fundable in bonds bearing <hi rend="italics"><num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num></hi> interest were funded in such bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />They are now only fundable in <hi rend="italics"><num value="0.07">seven per cent.</num></hi> bonds, and after <date value="08-01" authname="8-01">the first of August</date> they are <hi rend="italics">not to be ended at all.</hi> These are the notes that the banks decline to receive on deposit after tomorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />What the aggregate amount of them now afloat may be, we cannot say; but it must be large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />The time which has elapsed since the plan of coercing their holders to fund them was put in force is too brief to allow us to come to any other conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />There remains but <measure n="43days" type="date">forty-three days</measure> within which they may be funded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />After that they are only receivable in dues to the <rs>Government</rs>, except <unclear /> on imports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />It remains to be seen how much <unclear /> by the <name>Banks</name> can be absorbed by the <unclear /> at <num value="0.07">seven per cent.</num> till <date value="08-01" authname="8-01">the first of August</date> and the taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />The fewer that are left afloat the better for the people; but it is very clear that they are to lose considerably in any event.--Those notes are now not bankable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />They are in a great degree in the hands of people who are not able to fund them, and who will be compelled to pay them out or sell them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />As they will not be current they must be depreciated before <date value="08-01" authname="8-01">the first of August,</date> and will fall much lower after that. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" /> The plan of the <rs>Government</rs> for forcing the holder to convert the <rs>Government</rs> currency into bonds has been chiefly aimed at the notes that bore upon their face the promise that they would be funded in <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />The expedient of issuing such notes has been found to have been unwise, and we suppose the measure of forcing them in and cutting down the interest upon all not brought in by a certain day was deemed the best for retrieving the finances from such a blunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />We never believed in the policy of pledging the <rs>Government</rs> on the notes issued to the <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num>, and we have heretofore expressed the opinion that the plan of funding them for less was a partial repudiation by the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" /> But while the <rs>Government</rs> directs its measure for hastening the operation of funding its notes chiefly at these <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> issues, it appears that the screw is also applied to the balance of its circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />Holders are informed that the notes issued after the <date value="04-06" authname="4-06">6th of April</date> last will be funded at <num value="0.06">six per cent.</num> at any time within <measure n="12months" type="date">12 months</measure> after its issue — after that time at <num value="0.04">four per cent.</num> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" /> This system promises to bring confusion upon the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency, by establishing as great a disparity in the value of the notes of which it consists as there must exist in the <rs>Government</rs> bonds, which will bear respectively, <hi rend="italics"><num value="4">four</num>, <num value="6">six</num>, <num value="7">seven</num>,</hi> and <hi rend="italics"><num value="0.08">eight per cent</num></hi> interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />We cannot but regard such varying interest and such varying values in the notes issued by the <rs>Government</rs> as productive of advantage to none but those who <hi rend="italics">speculate in Government securities.</hi> They are calculated to embarrass the ordinary transactions of communities, and we apprehend will add nothing to the credit of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" /> The financial policy with which the <rs>Government</rs> begun operations was erroneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />The expedient of paying the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> interest that fell due on the public bonds in gold seems to have been an indication of that policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />Everything was to be gilded over to inspire confidence in the public credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" />And yet notes were issued promising <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num>, which argued that <sic>that</sic> credit needed an extravagant premium to help it along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />This was a mistake: it did not require these fictitious aids to inspire confidence in a Government whose resources are, for its population, superior to that of any Government on the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />Their abandonment by the <rs>Government</rs> proves this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" /> Of all the financial measures of the <rs>Government</rs>, that of imposing taxes for its support is the wisest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />That will do more for its credit and for the relief of the people by improving the value of the currency than anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />We base large calculations upon that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />It ought to have been resorted to a year sooner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />If the system of <hi rend="italics">driving</hi> the notes into the bonds succeeds thoroughly it will be a happy result, and will complete the work of lifting up the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />But we fear that while the inducement of <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> hurried in a large amount of notes to be funded, it will be found that <hi rend="italics"><num value="6">six</num></hi> and <hi rend="italics"><num value="4">four</num></hi> per cent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />will not have a like effect. </p> </q></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48" />The story of this simple occurrence, by the time that it reached <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, assumed a character that set the whole town wild with excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49" />Bulletin boards were crowded, and from lip to lip flew the astounding news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50" />The <orgName type="regiment" key="NY7">New York 7th Regiment</orgName>--such was the form which the arrest of <persName n="Lander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lander,nomatch:0" authname="lander"><surname full="yes">Lander</surname></persName> had assumed — was passing from <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland" authname="tgn,7013303">Annapolis</placeName> to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, when it was ambuscaded by a band of gallant Baltimoreans and "cut all to pieces." The scene was described with great partiality; the cars, containing the hapless <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 7">7th Regiment</orgName>, was made to run off the track near a stream that crossed their path, and, in this exposed condition, <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> they fell an easy prey to our unerring marksmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51" />It is a signal proof of our happy ignorance of war and its concomitants, that we were all credulous enough to swallow such a story, built on so slight a foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52" />There was a great reaction when it turned out that the story was not true, and despondent people began to entertain some doubts of the success of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53" />Scarce a day has passed since that period which has not given birth to some new and wonderful falsehood, until the mind of the most credulous has become an "exhausted receiver," in which Faith has lost its vitality, and whenever Truth does make her appearance, she finds at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few who are able to recognize her features and willing to do her reverence. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55" />We think it better deserves this distinction in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56" />The Northern lie is coarse, palpable, malignant, scarcely concealing the legion of devils that look out from it through a <num value="100">hundred</num> cracks and fissures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57" />The Southern <hi rend="italics">canard</hi> is graceful, romantic, and poetical, intended to entertain the public, like cake and wine between meals, till they can regale themselves upon something more substantial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58" />The Northern lie, like all other Northern operations, is a regular business transaction, having in view a practical purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59" />Thus it always lies about the numbers of the respective combatants engaged, about the results and about every circumstance of the war which, if truly represented, would redound to its discredit or injury at home or abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60" />The Southern fiction is obviously intended, like the <rs>Arabian Nights</rs>' Entertainments, to while away the tedium of the passing hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61" />It never misrepresents or perverts actual facts, but only seeks to stop the public maw between fights, that ravenous organ becoming hungry and clamorous if it is not fed with <num value="3">three</num> great battles, real or imaginary, every <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62" /> We do not mean to apologize for lying, in any of its forms, from the vindictive diabolism of a lie of malice, to the dramatic fiction fabricated simply for sensational purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63" />The wickedness of the <num value="1">one</num> and the weakness of the other are worthy the execration and the contempt of all honest men.
