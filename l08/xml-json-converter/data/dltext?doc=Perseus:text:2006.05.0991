<milestone unit="sentence" n="362" />If the <rs>Yankees</rs> were to come here to-morrow the worst enemies of the loyal people, the most cruel and savage persecutors of our cause and countrymen, would be these domestic traitors, who are unmolested in person, estate, or liberty by our people and our Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363" /> But the time has come when the truth that those who are not for us are against us, must be practically recognized, and that pitiful minority of men and women who do not regard this as their country, must be sent to that country which they do regard as such, and not permitted to remain here, to assist <name>Yankee</name> prisoners to escape and plot treason against the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364" />It is the custom of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> to send from its own limits better people than themselves for not half their offences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365" />Men and women have been expelled from the <rs>North</rs>, and driven from their homes and property, for manifesting sympathy with the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, and, unless we are lost to all self respect, and all sense of justice to our own countrymen, we will commend the same chalice to the lips of the traitors and miscreants here who are plotting the overthrow of the <rs>Government</rs> and the restoration of the "glorious old flag."
