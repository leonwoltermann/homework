<milestone unit="sentence" n="134" /> We have often taken occasion to declare — what, indeed, it was hardly necessary to declare — that we make no pretensions whatever to any knowledge of the art military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135" />Some common sense, however, we do lay claim to; and under the influence of that useful, and by no means common gift, we do not hesitate to say that the expedition of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0" authname="sherman"><surname full="yes">Sherman</surname></persName> into <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 6" reg="georgia" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> of the most ridiculous conceptions that ever entered into the mind of man. There was no object that he could possibly gain at all commensurate with the advantages he was certain to lose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136" />If <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0" authname="hood"><surname full="yes">Hood</surname></persName> had cut off his supplies and interrupted his communications, he should have followed the <name>Napoleonic</name> injunction: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, settle everything, if possible, in front, and then clear your communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137" />He should have turned back upon <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0" authname="hood"><surname full="yes">Hood</surname></persName>, defeated and paralyzed his army, and <hi rend="italics">then</hi> returned to <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331" authname="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138" />But his egregious vanity had already committed so far that he knew not how to go back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139" />Blated by the retreat of <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0" authname="johnston"><surname full="yes">Johnston</surname></persName> — which was undoubtedly the result of profound calculation on the part of that great officer — and mistaking entirely the object of that retreat, he imagined that it was compulsory and had been produced by his own skilful combinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140" />When he had succeeded in defeating <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0" authname="hood"><surname full="yes">Hood</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Jonesboro, Clayton, Georgia" key="tgn,2023284" authname="tgn,2023284">Jonesborough</placeName> — a defeat productive, absolutely, of not <num value="1">one</num> single advantage to the <rs>Yankee</rs> cause — he grew mad with self-esteem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141" />He not only published the most extravagant and exaggerated accounts of what he had done, but actually proclaimed to the world that his campaign was a model for all military men to study in future — a piece of arrogance that would have been disgusting even in Cæsar or <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924" authname="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>, and which neither of these mighty generals thought of indulging in. After having gone so far — when <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0" authname="hood"><surname full="yes">Hood</surname></persName> fell upon his rear and cut off his communications — shame forbade him to take the retrograde and to confess that his boasted conquests were no conquests at all. The Yankee mob would have tern down his statue from the pedestal and degraded him from the lofty elevation which his own falsehoods and their boundless credulity had assigned to him; and that was, to a mind so full of vanity and ostentation, worse than death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142" />He seems, therefore, to have resolved upon the expedition to <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> as a last desperate expedient to prove the just ground of all his previous vaporings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143" />He had said that the whole country he had passed over was completely subdued, and that there was no longer any danger in it. He had spoken contemptuously of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0" authname="hood"><surname full="yes">Hood</surname></persName> and his operations, and he now determined to show that he felt as he spoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144" />Wounded vanity seems to have been at the bottom of all his proceedings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145" /> What he expected to gain in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> we do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146" />We think it pretty certain, however, that he did not expect much opposition, and that he did expect to meet with much encouragement and assistance from the population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147" />We should infer thus much from his <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> prescribing the rules to be observed in marching, and from his having determined to discard supply trains and trust to feeding on the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148" />In both these calculations he has been signally deceived, if all the accounts be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149" />From the inhabitants, he has met with no assistance or co-operation whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150" />In every case in which it was possible, they have either fled at his approach or taken up arms against him. The Yankee newspapers heralded his advance by pompous anticipations of the mighty captures he was to make and the mighty effect his invasion was to produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151" />It was to cut off the portions of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> whence, according to their accounts, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0" authname="lee"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName> receives his supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152" />It was to flank <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0" authname="lee"><surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName> out of his position and deliver <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> over to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0" authname="grant"><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153" />It was to recapture the <num value="40000">40,000</num> or <num value="50000">50,000</num> <name>Yankee</name> prisoners that they said were in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154" />It was to take <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498" authname="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> and <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980" authname="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName>, where, they said, were the main rebel powder mills and magazines of every kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155" />It was to take <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582" authname="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487" authname="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and crush the rebellion by the capture of these rebellious strongholds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156" />If he designed any of these things, and the <rs>Yankee</rs> journals gave him credit for designing them all, yet was disappointment more complete; and if he fancied, as the same papers seem to have done, that the population would receive him with joy and the <name>Legislature</name> rapturously hail his advent as the signal for restoring the <rs>Union</rs>, never was self-deception more deplorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157" />We know not where he is.--His very friends have been firing guns by day, and sending up rockets by night, all along the coast for the last week, with the hope of discovering his where abouts, in vain, while <num value="2">two</num> exploring expeditions, sent forward for the same purpose, have been signally defeated and thrust back to their boats.
