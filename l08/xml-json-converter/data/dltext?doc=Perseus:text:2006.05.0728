<milestone unit="sentence" n="267" /> The opinion expressed in this journal a few days since with reference to the supplies is in course of confirmation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268" />They are increasing and must still further be increased by the improving reads and the new policy of the <rs>Government</rs>, in relaxing the rigors of impressment and obstructions to transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269" />Prices have receded, and must drop down lower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271" />Quotations reduced here must be followed by a reduction everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272" />Holders for higher prices must let go their stocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273" />It will be suicide to hold in the face of a decline which is forced by the evident fact that there is a great deal more of all the necessaries of life — of bread and meat and forage — in the country than speculators either themselves believed or made the people believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274" />We are to have large supplies from productive districts held for many months by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275" />They will be taken chiefly for the army, but will diminish the drafts of the army upon other districts, which will have so much the more for the citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276" />It is to be hoped that the ensuing seasons will be favorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277" />If so, the increased production, under the determination of the farmers to multiply their crops of breadstuffs, and curtail those of tobacco and cotton, will improve the condition of the country generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278" />The army will in that case have an abundant supply, and so will the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279" />Prices will at least be comparatively moderate, and a wise policy of taxation by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> will keep them down greatly below the mad and ruinous rates which have for some months prevailed.
