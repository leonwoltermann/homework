<head>Ships and batteries.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" /> We gave some months ago a minute history of the conflicts between ships and batteries in the great wars of modern times, both in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> and in our own country, from which it appeared that, in the great majority of cases, vessels of war were unable to compete with strong land fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />In all the wars of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> with the continental nations, and in the war of the <rs>American Revolution</rs> and <dateStruct value="1812--" full="yes" authname="1812"><year reg="1812" full="yes">1812</year></dateStruct>, there was scarcely <num value="1">one</num> exception to this general rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />That such does not seem to be the experience of the present war, is attributed by some to the introduction of steam, and the greater perfection in the mechanical agencies both of the ship and armament, and the more powerful and destructive character of the materials of war. This is an important subject in a country so assailable by sea as our own, which has no navy, and can only rely upon its shore defences to meet the numerous fleets of an enemy who has the whole navy and the whole mercantile marine, now armed, of the all <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at his command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" /> We confess that we have seen nothing <unclear /> of the experiences of this war to change our conviction of the superiority of land fortifications, when properly constructed and efficiently armed, to ships-of-war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />The introduction of steam and other naval improvements has not reversed the relative strength of fortifications and vessels, though it undoubtedly requires the former, in order to maintain their old superiority, to be something more than mere earth works, without bomb-proof coverings, which, at <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina" authname="tgn,3000601">Hatteras</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511" authname="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, were easily reduced by the vigorous shelling of the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />The conflict at <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972" authname="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName> was the only fair illustration of the question which the present war has furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />There the fortifications were properly constructed, the men were sheltered by those defences which military art has provided against the descent of shells, the guns were of proper range, and handled by skillful and practised gunners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />The consequence was, that some of the enemy's most powerful ships-of-war were perfectly riddled by the fire of the fortifications, and abandoned the contest precipitately, having failed to inflict the slightest injury upon the works of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and only killing <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> men. We believe that the result would be the same in every similar engagement between shore and <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating batteries</orgName> if the former are properly built, provided with bomb-proofs, and guns of equal range with the enemy, and manned by experienced gunners, who have been disciplined and practiced to the skillful performance of their duties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" /> If the application of steam to ships of war and other naval improvements accounts for the success of the enemy in his <num value="2">two</num> assaults upon inconsiderable earthworks, how is it that the great naval squadrons of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> were unable to assail <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Luzerne, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2650582" authname="tgn,2650582">Sebastopol</placeName> and other <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska" authname="tgn,2634462">Russian</placeName> seacoast fortifications with any success, but came off worsted in every encounter, whilst <persName n="Napier,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0" authname="napier"><roleName n="Admiral" full="yes">Admiral</roleName> <surname full="yes">Napier</surname></persName> did not even attempt to cope with <placeName key="tgn,7013405" n="1.000 4" reg="kronshtadt,kotlin,leningradskaya oblast',rossiya,rossiya,asia" authname="tgn,7013405">Cronstadt</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />There was scarcely a sailing vessel in either of these magnificent fleets, the equal of which in numbers, guns, and all the equipments and appliances of war, had never before floated upon the waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />The single ship which bore the broad pennant of <persName n="Napier,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0" authname="napier"><roleName n="Admiral" full="yes">Admiral</roleName> <surname full="yes">Napier</surname></persName>, the largest and most powerful war ship in the world, would be more than a match for <num value="3">three</num> of the best ships in the <rs>Yankee</rs> navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />Every <num value="1">one</num> recollects the impression produced upon the public mind of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> by the magnificent naval review which took place before <persName n="Napier,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0" authname="napier"><roleName n="Admiral" full="yes">Admiral</roleName> <surname full="yes">Napier</surname></persName> sailed for the <rs>Baltic</rs>, and never did Old England seem more completely mistress of the seas than when that vast squadron of magnificent steamships-of-war, led by the colossal flag-ship of the <rs>Admiral</rs>, set sail for the enemy's waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />It would be ridiculous to compare the <num value="50">fifty</num> ships-of-war which comprise the <rs>Yankee</rs> navy, and their fleet of old merchantmen, patched up for fighting purposes, with the grand <orgName n="English squadron" type="squadron">English squadron</orgName> of <persName n="Napier,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0" authname="napier"><surname full="yes">Napier</surname></persName> in any <num value="1">one</num> particular that gives efficiency to a ship in these times; in machinery, guns, armament and missiles, crews or gunners; and yet it came back to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> without having reduced or even engaged a single <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska" authname="tgn,2634462">Russian</placeName> fortification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />We must evidently look to some other cause than naval improvements for the <rs>Yankee</rs> successes at <placeName key="tgn,7005502" n="1.000 7" reg="haiti" authname="tgn,7005502">Haiti</placeName><unclear /> <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511" authname="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, and that cause is to be <unclear>fo</unclear> the weakness of the fortifications, rather than in the strength of the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />If <persName n="Hatteras,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hatteras,nomatch:0" authname="hatteras"><surname full="yes">Hatteras</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511" authname="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> had been provided with proper defences against the shell and-shot of the enemy, the result would have been different, as it will be hereafter, if we do not neglect the common provisions against naval assault which have elsewhere rendered shore batteries invulnerable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" /> We do not recollect but <num value="1">one</num> single success which the combined fleets of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, both in the <rs type="place">Baltic</rs> and the <rs type="place">Black Seas</rs>, achieved during the <rs>Russian</rs> war. That was the reduction of the fortification of Kinburn by the iron-plated vessels introduced by <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,," authname="napoleon,louis"><foreName full="yes">Louis</foreName> <surname full="yes">Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />That experiment served to demonstrate the capacity of vessels sheltered with that metal to resist the fire of the forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />But it is, of course, clear that fortifications sheltered in the same armor would be equally invulnerable by ships of war, and an English periodical has lately argued that this defence can be provided as readily and even more economically for fortifications than ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />We earnestly hope that our Government and engineers will give this subject their prompt and serious attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />We have our choice of <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972" authname="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511" authname="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> in future conflicts between fortifications and ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />It is hardly worth while to construct coast and river defences merely as slaughter pens for our brave soldiers, and only to invite the enemy to make an attack in which he has every advantage of assault, and little peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />If we do not wish to build defences merely that they may be taken, and involve in their destruction the loss of both life and prestige, let us construct them upon proper principles, and we shall have no future repetitions of <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina" authname="tgn,3000601">Hatteras</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511" authname="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101" />Proceeding as at present with our military campaign, it would be no strange thing to have the <q direct="unspecified">"Southern Confederacy"</q> acknowledged by foreign Powers, and our Government would then stand before the civilized world humiliated and disgraced — Our army had long been ready, and our soldiers were burning and panting for the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102" />We had earnestly cast about for a bold and daring leader, ready for the great contest, and it was painful to confess at this late day, that the country had looked in vain for a <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in Chief</rs> exhibiting the will and the requisite enterprise and genius to lead our forces on to victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103" />He asked what stood in the way of meeting the enemy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104" />Was it the fear that somebody would be hurt, or did the ghost of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988" authname="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> hover above the minds of our commanding <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105" />We had lost more men by disease and sickness during the last <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> than we should have probably lost in half-a-dozen general engagements, and hundreds of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of money had been spent, and <num value="1">one</num> of the largest armies of the world gathered to remain comparatively idle, and become weak and demoralized by inactivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106" />If we desired the respect of our own people, and the moral support of the world, we would strike out boldly for victory, and trust to good powder, strong arms, to well aimed guns, and to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107" />It would be better to meet with occasional reverses than to remain inactive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108" />If we did not fight with justice, right, and human freedom on our side, our people would become discouraged, the <name>Treasury</name> bankrupt, and the <rs>Government</rs> brought into contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109" />Did a General stand in the way to hold in check more than half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, take him out of the way, give his place to another, if there be no other remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110" /><rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, of themselves, are nothing in this contest, when thrown into the balance against the honor and integrity of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111" />If the angel <rs>Gabriel</rs> commanded our forces, and failed to march against the enemy, he would petition to the court to which he holds allegiance for his instant dismissal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112" />This war had reached a point where <rs n="kid gloves" type="product">kid gloves</rs>, pleasant words, and gilded promise were of no use. The hour demanded hard words and harder blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113" />This contest must close either in the ruin of a republic that has been the admiration of the world, and possibly the destruction of civil and religious freedom in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611" authname="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, or in the perfect supremacy of law and order and the stability of our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114" />He had faith in the latter result, for revolutions move the world forward — never backward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115" />He asked the <rs>Clerk</rs> to read a striking article from the <orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi></orgName> showing up our military blunders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116" />Its truth-fulness, he said, could not be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117" />We had let slip golden opportunities for crushing this rebellion, and of achieving brilliant victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118" />The great cause of dissatisfaction among our troops was that they were not permitted to strike at the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119" />He preferred no charges against the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander in Chief</rs>; but, in his judgment, the man did not live who could successfully command <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men, scattered over a territory of <measure n="2000miles" type="distance">two thousand miles</measure>. Yet the destiny of this republic had long hung upon the volition of the will of a single man. No other Government invested its <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> with such unlimited authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120" />No man had been found great enough to use the supreme command of even <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121" />A part of the tremendous burden thrown upon the shoulders of our young General should be removed, and divided so as to call out the best energies of the best officers, and secure general unity of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122" />Thus far our commanders have been the victims of some fixed, unalterable plan, the fruit of <num value="1">one</num> mind, which plan had accomplished but <measure n="1bmark" type="currency"><num value="1">one</num> mark</measure>ed result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123" />It had prevented <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num> men from attempting precisely what they came together to accomplish — that was, to fight and whip the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124" />The very men who must receive the shock of battle were those who complained most of inactivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125" />He said that if the question were left to them <num value="10">ten</num> out of <num value="12">twelve</num> would say there had been no necessity for the delay of the past <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>. He revealed no secret when he stated that the great plan was to strike at all points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126" />It was a simple impossibility that every arrangement was to be made in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523" authname="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255" authname="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, so that as by a single click of the clock all would rush upon the enemy at once, and crush the rebellion at a single blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129" />It might have finished the <q direct="unspecified">"great anaconda,"</q> as the newspapers have expressed it. But it must not be forgotten that the mammoth reptile that was to draw within his folds and crush the rebellion at a single sweep of his tail, had already swallowed up our contemplated victories and gorged himself with the substance of the people to no purpose. </p> </q></cit> </div3>
