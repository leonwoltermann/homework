<milestone unit="sentence" n="177" />His eyes were dark, his glance penetrating, his complexion colorless, and his nose straight and somewhat thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178" />His mouth was small and regular, and the lips, rather full, gave to the lower part of his face an expression of kindliness, while his breadth of forehead indicated the development of the intellectual faculties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182" />Accustomed from his youth is many exercise, he was a bold horseman; and he supported with ease privations and fatigues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183" />Habitually abstemious, his health was not weakened by <unclear /> of labor, nor by excess of pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185" />He paid particular attention to his person, <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> shaved with care, or had the hairs plucked out; he brought forward artistically his hair to the front of his head, and this, in his more advanced age, served to conceal his baldness. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188" />His gown was generally bordered with the laticlam, ornamented with fringes to the hands, and was bound round the loins by a sash loosely knotted — a fashion which distinguished the elegant and effeminate youth of the period.
