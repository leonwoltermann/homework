<head>Tall holt better than no holt.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765" /> The following laughable affair is from a book entitled <placeName reg="Fisher's River">Fisher's River</placeName> Scenes and Characters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766" />The incident is located in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709" authname="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767" />It is the story of a man named <q direct="unspecified">"<persName n="Stanley,,Oliver,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00534" reg="default:Stanley,Oliver,,," authname="stanley,oliver"><foreName full="yes">Oliver</foreName> <surname full="yes">Stanley</surname></persName>,"</q> who was taken captive by wild <q direct="unspecified">"Injuns,"</q> After some consideration, they put him into an empty oil barrel and headed him up, leaving the bung hole open that he might be longer dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768" />The prisoner relates a portion of his experience in this wise: </p> <cit><q direct="unspecified"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769" /> I determined to get out'n that or bust a trace; and so I pounded away with my fist till; I beat it into nearly a jelly, at the end of the bar'l but it were no go. Then I butted a spell with my noggin, but I had no purchase like old rams when they butt; fur, you know, they back ever so far when they make a tilt.--So I caved in, made my last will and testament, and virtually gave up the ghost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770" />It war a mighty serious time with me, to be sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771" />While I were lying there, balancing accounts with t'other world, and afore I had all my figgers made out to see how things 'nd stand, I heard suthin' scrambulating in the leaves, and snortin' every whipstitch like he smelt suthin' he didn't <sic>aczactly</sic> like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772" />I lay as still as a salamander, and thought, maybe there's chance fur <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00535" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Oliver,,," authname="stanley,oliver"><surname full="yes">Stanley</surname></persName> yit. So the critter, whatever it mout be, kep' moseyin round the bar'l. Last he came to the bunghole, put his nose in, smelt mighty perticuler, and gin a monstrous loud short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773" />I holt what little breath I had to keep the critter from smellin' the intarnals ov that bar'l. I soon seen it was a bar of the woods — the big king bar of the woods, who had lived thar from time immortal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774" />Thinks I, old fellow look out; old <persName n="Oliver,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00536" reg="mostcommon:Oliver,nomatch:0" authname="oliver"><surname full="yes">Oliver</surname></persName> ain't dead yit. Jist then, he put his black paw in jist as fur as he could, and scrabbled about to make 'scovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775" />The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tho't I had was to nab his paw, as a drowndin' max will ketch at a straw; but I soon seen that wouldn't do, for you see he couldn't then travel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776" />So I jist waited a spell with great flatterbation of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777" />The next move he made was to put his tall in at the bunghole ov the bar'l to test inards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778" />I seen that were my time to mark my <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00537" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0" authname="jack"><surname full="yes">Jack</surname></persName>; so I seized my holt, and shouted at the top ov my voice: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779" /> <q direct="unspecified">"Charge, <persName n="Chester,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00538" reg="mostcommon:Chester,nomatch:0" authname="chester"><surname full="yes">Chester</surname></persName>, charge!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780" />On, <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00539" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Oliver,,," authname="stanley,oliver"><surname full="yes">Stanley</surname></persName>, on!"</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781" /> And the bar he put, and I knowed tall holt were better than no holt; and so we went, bar'l and all, the bar full speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782" />Now, my hope were that the bar would <hi rend="italics">jump over some pressepiss,</hi> break the bar'l all to shiverations, and liberate me from my nasty, stinkin', <unclear>ily </unclear> prison, and sure 'nuff, the bar at full speed leaped over a caterack <hi rend="italics"><num value="50">fifty</num> foot high.</hi> Down we went together in a pile, codswallop, on a big rock, bustin' the bar'l and nearly shakin' my gizzard out' me. I let go my tall-holt-- had no more use for it — and away went the bar like a whirly gust ov woodpeckers were after it. I've never seen nor heard from that bar since, but he has my best wishes for his present and future welfare. </p> </q><bibl default="NO" /></cit> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
