"If," says the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> "the war were felt by them to be a National war, in the sense in which this phrase is ordinarily understood, a war in which everything that men hold dear was at stake, and in which death was preferable to submission, it is impossible to believe that their resistance to <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0" authname="sherman"><surname full="yes">Sherman</surname></persName>'s progress would have been so feeble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" /> "There is only <num value="1">one</num> interpretation that can be put on this extraordinary apathy, and that is, that confidence in the success of the rebellion no longer exists anywhere outside of the official class and the army, if it exist there.
