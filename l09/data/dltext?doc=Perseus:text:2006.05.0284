<milestone unit="sentence" n="193" />To do him nothing more than justice, we must say that his calmness and valor on that occasion won our highest admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194" />If ever a man under any circumstances exhibited a combination of boldness and prudence, <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0" authname="floyd"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Floyd</surname></persName> did so during the whole of that terrible conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196" />And although he was wounded at the beginning of the battle, yet no <num value="1">one</num>, except a few friends around him, knew any thing of it until the fight was over.--He kept his flag flying all the time in full <milestone unit="column" n="5" /> view of the enemy, while he himself walked up and down in front of it, speaking to his men and encouraging them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197" />But there was <num value="1">one</num> exploit that he performed which was sufficient of itself to immortalize him as a brave man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199" />He neither drinks liquor, nor gambles, nor uses profane language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200" />He has the greatest respect for religion and those who profess it. He treats his officers in the most cordial and dignified manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201" />He uses every care for the welfare of his soldiers.--He is courteous towards strangers and those who may visit his camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202" />In a word, he is kind to all around him. He will not allow his men to injure any private or public property, except there be a military necessity for it, so that he is looked upon in this part of the country as a protector.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205" />If we may be allowed to form an estimate of his character from personal observation and daily intercourse with him in the camp and on the field of battle, the conclusion must inevitably be that he is truly a great man and a skillful General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206" />It may be that he has some enemies, but we hazard the opinion that if they were with him during his present campaign, their animosity would be changed into friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207" />We predict for him a glorious career as a military chieftain, and whenever he goes to battle for our civil liberties we shall follow him, till we secure our independence or die in the attempt. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250" />There is an irrepressible conflict between <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999" authname="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> and volunteer nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251" />The struggle has been a very hurtful <num value="1">one</num> to the <rs>Confederate</rs> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252" /><placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999" authname="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> must give way, or our armies are in danger of disbanding with the expiration of the present terms of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253" />The subject is <num value="1">one</num> of very serious importance; for the evil may go on until it drives our military forces out of the field, and leaves our liberties to be protected only by an irregular system of warfare which might soon end in utter overthrow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254" /> The ideas of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999" authname="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> are modeled after those of <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Frederick, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002161" authname="tgn,2002161">Frederick</placeName></hi> the <rs>Great</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255" />He was an absolute monarch, and the veriest martinet and petty tyrant that ever breathed the air. A great General he certainly was; and it was only his genius which relieved his reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257" /> <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999" authname="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> would treat the volunteers precisely in the manner in which the <rs>Prussian King</rs> treated his grenadiers — as so many inanimate blocks of wood, to be kicked and thrust about at pleasure; as a part of a grand piece of mechanism, in the form of an army, which differs not at all from so much wood or stone except that it must be furnished enough coarse food to sustain life, and enough rest and sleep to satisfy the necessities of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258" />The volunteers are not blocks of wood or lamps of stone; they are not mere soldiers; they are men, citizens, <hi rend="italics">people</hi> volunteering to render service as soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259" />To bring the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> and <placeName reg="Berlin, Southampton, Virginia" key="tgn,2110638" authname="tgn,2110638">Berlin</placeName> idea to bear on them, is not only to ignore what they really are and to regard them as something that they are <hi rend="italics">not,</hi> but it is to fail utterly to elicit from them the service either of citizen soldiers or regular troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260" /> <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999" authname="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> at the head of volunteer gentlemen and citizens presents almost as incongruous a spectacle as was exhibited by that madcap <name>British</name> officer, during the war of <dateStruct value="1812--" full="yes" authname="1812"><year reg="1812" full="yes">1812</year></dateStruct>, who spent a year in Spanish Florida in training regimentally <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2000">two thousand</num> Seminoles in the tactics of the regular <name>British</name> infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261" />No sooner did he bring his uniformed, strapped, and heavily accoutered savages into action, than they all took incontinently to the trees, leaving <num value="1">one</num> of the best drill officers and most pragmatical martinets of the <rs>British</rs> service no other alternative than to turn Indian likewise and betake himself to the bushes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262" /> The illustration is only apt in the incongruity of each case; for the <sic>volunteeers</sic> will do as good and as scientific fighting as regulars; but the effort to apply the rude and harsh discipline of the regular service to them is as idle as to expect an Indian to make as good a regular as a Hessian. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263" /> At best, considered personally, the <name>West Pointers</name> are mere cadets, educated at a public melee monastery school; while the volunteers are the people — the country who have provided and supported the institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264" />Was it ever supposed or intended that men educated by the people for the performance of a specific duty were, in its performance, to as same the hauteur of masters, and to bear them selves to the volunteers as if they were mer œnaries, or as if they were like Hessians, born expressly for regular soldiers, to be sworn at like the army in <persName n="Flanders,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Flanders,nomatch:0" authname="flanders"><surname full="yes">Flanders</surname></persName>, with backs formed to be kicked and souls fitted to be <q direct="unspecified">"damned?"</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265" /> The mere manners of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999" authname="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> might, however, be borne with, if they were not contagious, and did not communicate themselves to the officers from civil life who never saw the <placeName reg="Little Choptank River, Dorchester, Maryland" key="tgn,2453427" authname="tgn,2453427">Hudson river</placeName>; thus sowing the elements of dissolution throughout our volunteer armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266" />Unless these manners are corrected, the present army is the last <num value="1">one</num> which the <rs>South</rs> will ever bring into the service; force volunteers themselves, their fathers, mothers and sisters, had rather see their country over run, and submit to be murdered by the enemy, than to see their brave boys subjected to in dignities and insults which would, be afflicting even to hired regulars or insensitive Hessians. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267" /> In the management of the war, too, <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999" authname="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> has wholly mistaken the material under their command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268" />They have persisted in conducting our campaigns as if our victories were to be won by <hi rend="italics">armies;</hi> when, in fact, it is only by regarding the armies as bodies of <unclear /> that they can be made to win victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269" />It was the <hi rend="italics">men</hi> of the <name>States</name> who whipped the <name>Mexicans</name> in every battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270" />Their armies were more numerous, fully as well officered and far better disciplined in the technical duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271" />We fought their <q direct="unspecified">"armies"</q> with our <hi rend="italics">men.</hi> We had no regulars in that campaign, except a very few <num value="1000">thousands</num>, commanded by <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999" authname="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272" />That institution was on hand to do whatever scientific work was needful, and it did it well; but the fighting was done by the <hi rend="italics">men</hi> of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273" />We cannot win this war unless the undivided during and impetuosity of our volunteers be allowed scope, unfettered by the cautions circumspection and rigid technicality of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999" authname="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>. </p>
