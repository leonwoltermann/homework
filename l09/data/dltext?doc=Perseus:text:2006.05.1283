<milestone unit="sentence" n="234" /> On the <dateStruct value="--21" full="yes" authname="---21"><day reg="21" full="yes">21st ultimo</day></dateStruct> it came on to blow hard from the southwest, and a very heavy sea commenced rolling in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237" />I at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <milestone unit="column" n="5" /> thought I had been imprudent, and had unnecessarily risked the lives of officers and men, but I went to sleep the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> night of the gale quite easy in my mind in regard to the monitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238" />I saw that they were making the best weather and riding easier than any of the other vessels in the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239" />All the transports cut and run; though I think that was quite unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240" />After the gale, I inquired of the commanders of the monitors how they passed through the ordeal, and they seemed to think they got along very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241" />The smaller monitors — <rs type="ship2">Mahopac</rs> and <persName n="Canonicus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Canonicus,nomatch:0" authname="canonicus"><surname full="yes">Canonicus</surname></persName> — at times almost disappeared from view, and the commander of the former vessel complained of discomfort, owing to the decks leaking; but the vessels were in no danger at any time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242" /> As to the <rs>Monadnock</rs>, she could ride out a gale at anchor in the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206" authname="tgn,7014206">Atlantic ocean</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243" />She is certainly a most perfect success so far as the hull and machinery are concerned, and is only defective in some minor details, which, in the building of these vessels, require the superintendence of a thorough seaman and a practical and ingenious man. The <rs>Monadnock</rs> is capable of crossing the ocean alone (when her compasses are once adjusted properly), and could destroy any vessel in the <rs>French</rs> or <rs>British</rs> navy, lay their towns under contribution, and return again (provided she could pick up coal) without fear of being followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244" />She could certainly clear any harbor on our coast of blockaders in case we were at war with a foreign Power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245" />As strong and thick as the sides of this vessel are, <num value="1">one</num> heavy shot from <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina" authname="tgn,6002050">Fort Fisher</placeName> indented the iron on her side armor, without, however, doing any material damage. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247" />Compared with the ironsides, their fire is very slow, and not at all calculated to silence heavy batteries, which require a rapid and continuous fire to drive men from their guns; but they are famous coadjutors in a fight, and put in the heavy blows which tell on casemates and bombproof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248" />The smaller class of monitors, as at present constructed, will always require the aid of a steamer to tow them and take care of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249" />In smooth weather they ought to go along by themselves, and, when towed, the tow-rope should never be less than <num value="200">two hundred</num> fathoms in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250" />It strains them very much to have a short tow line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251" /> I do not know yet what their real durability is, or would be, in a continuous fire against their turrets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252" />Solid <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11-inch</measure> or <num value="200">200</num>-pounder rifles are apt to break something when they strike, and I should be much better satisfied myself to be behind <unclear /> what comes than to be shut up in an iron turret, not knowing whether it is properly constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253" />This, though, is the prejudice of a sailor, and should have no weight whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254" />The commanders of the monitors seem to feel quite at home and safe in them, and apprehend no more damage at sea than in any other kind of vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259" />There is no great amount of comfort on board these vessels at sea; that is conceded on all sides; but they are seldom at sea, and only exposed when making a voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262" />The fire of these vessels, continued with the fire of such vessels as the New Ironsides and heavy frigates, is very effective, particularly against heavy plated vessels, bombproof and stone or brick walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263" />I have never yet seen a vessel that came up to my ideas of what is required for offensive operations as much as the <rs>Ironsides</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264" />She combines very many good qualities.
