<milestone unit="sentence" n="293" />In his speech in Congress he declared that he had rather see the <rs>Southern States</rs> independent than to see their people, men, women and children, exterminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294" />In his speech to his constituents he put the question more pointedly and positively, as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break" direct="unspecified"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295" /> "That there is no other alternative in this war than subjugation and extermination of the <rs>Southern</rs> people on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, or the recognition of their Confederacy on the other, is beyond question; and how can any sensible, humane, and liberty-loving man hesitate in preferring the latter?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299" /> He explained his States' rights views and defended the sovereignty of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300" />They were separate colonies — they threw off the allegiance to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> as separate States--they were recognized as independent, separate States after the war of the <name>Revolution</name> — they had, during the war, been allied sovereignties under the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation, and their allegiance as such was continued under the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <dateStruct value="1789--" full="yes" authname="1789"><year reg="1789" full="yes">1789</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301" />He gave the history of the <rs>Convention</rs> which framed that instrument to prove that the power to coerce a State by force was proposed to be engrafted upon it and rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302" />He contended that there was no such power granted by the <name>States</name> to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and that from the day that <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,," authname="lincoln,abraham"><foreName full="yes">Abraham</foreName> <surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> called for <num value="75000">75,000</num> men to be used against the <name>States</name> that had seceded, the old Government had ceased to exist, and that they of the <rs>North</rs> had "been living for more than <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> under a new Government — a Government necessarily despotic, because the <rs>Constitution</rs> being set aside, the man who rules over us (them) is absolutely without restraint of any kind, except that imposed by his own will." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303" /> He warned the people against centralization:--it <hi rend="italics">did</hi> not lead to despotism — it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> despotism itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304" />Nothing excited more the anxiety of our revolutionary forefathers than this fear of centralization of power in the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305" />A powerful despotism might be splendid; but its splendor was a poor consolation for the degradation of the people, and "for the loss of all their liberties, all that ennobles life and dignities manhood." </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307" />That madness, said he, "combined with the unnatural idea of placing the negro upon a level with the white man, has deluged this land in blood, has impoverished us with debt and taxation, and destroyed the constitutional liberty bequeathed to us by our ancestors." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308" /> <persName n="Long,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="nearbymention:Long,Alexander,,," authname="long,alexander"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Long</surname></persName> assailed <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,," authname="lincoln,abraham"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>'s administration, denounced its corruptions and declared there was no hope for the <rs>North</rs> but in driving it from the <rs>Capitol</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309" />He declared that the <rs>South</rs> could never be subjugated, and there was no hope of peace but in recognizing its independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310" />He avowed his firm purposed to maintain these views, and defied the power of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,," authname="lincoln,abraham"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> and his agents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313" />It will continue to tread in the downward career of folly and crime in the hope that upon the bloody car of revolution which is crushing the masses to death, its chiefs can side to positions of imperial splendor and individual greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314" />In the dark vista of the future there is not <num value="1">one</num> single ray of hope it the blessed sun of peace does not soon ascend the national horizon and shed its effulgent rays upon our land. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319" /> A speech like this gives a better sign than any other that appears in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320" />There is really no hope for the <rs>North</rs> but in the independence of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321" />When the people are prepared to look this fact full in the face, and to applaud the hold and manly public servant who announces and triumphantly vindicates it before them, we may believe that there is a sober <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought working <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> its way amongst them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322" />And when we consider that such declarations, so received, are permitted by the <rs>Government</rs> which would, <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago, have imprisoned and probably banished from the country the author of them, we may well conclude that a great change has come over the <rs>North</rs>, and that the tyranny at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> is checked some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324" /> The <orgName n="Philadelphia Inquirer" type="newspaper">Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi></orgName> quotes the prices fixed for wheat by the <rs>Virginia Commissioners</rs>, and tells its readers to cheer up, that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is about "going up; they can't stand it another year." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325" /> Yes, we are "going," we trust, "up;" for that is certainly not the direction in which the <rs>Yankees</rs> will go!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326" />We are, moreover, rapidly acquiring that condition most favorable for ascension — lightness of body, freedom from fleshly solidity and ponderously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327" />The Yankee war of starvation has reduced us all to a state of gauntness that foretokens a nation of skeletons; and <num value="1">one</num> day the well-fed hordes of Northern barbarians and plunderers will meet a Southern army of fleshless men, who will so resemble the escaped tenants of the graveyards that their adversaries, horror stricken, will deem the day of judgment come, and howling, abandon themselves to despair; for the enormities they, have done will make that day, <num value="1">one</num> of unimaginable wretchedness and misery to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328" />Before an army of ghosts they could never stand; and it is plain, if we can get nothing to eat, to that pass we must come; for starve or not, we mean to resist.--Let, then, the <rs>Yankees</rs> take no courage from the last of the dire auxiliaries they have conjured up from hell!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329" />Even <hi rend="smallcaps">Famine</hi> we will endure rather than submit to <name>Yankee</name> domination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330" />We have, as already confessed, given strong proof of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331" />We are living on short allowance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332" />The head of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> is a sort of representative of the physical Southern Confederate: and, as it has been already stated, his bones are heard to rattle as he descends the stairs of his hotel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333" /><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is a mere shadow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334" />He has become even transparent, and like the chameleon, borrows his hue from the color of the nearest object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335" />When standing by a brick wall he is ruddy, and when resting under the shade of a tree he is green!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336" />Only think of all this, <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, and dance and shout over the poor Confederacy, reduced to skin and bones, and about to "go up!" The bare contemplation of this is enough to make the <rs>Puritan</rs> go mad with joy, and at once renew his thanks to his maker that he "is not like other men;" which he, nevertheless, cannot do with half the sincerity and emphasis with which "other men" do thank their <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that they are not like him! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337" /> The <orgName n="Philadelphia Inquirer" type="newspaper">Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi></orgName>, with the example of the increased cost of all things, because of the depreciation in Federal greenbacks, might have explained high prices here on the same principle — the depreciation of Confederate currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338" />But it is just as well that we should encourage the <rs>Yankees</rs> to believe that their scheme of starving the <rs>South</rs> is succeeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339" />They are continually felicitating themselves with the impression that it is. The demon who attempts to reduce his victim to submission by persecution, even to the extreme of starvation, and fails, suffers a mortification and wretchedness proportionate to the crucify and brutality of the means he had employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340" />So the <rs>Yankees</rs>, when they find that all their villainies, all their horrid brutalities, were vainly exerted against the spirit, the valor, and loyalty of the <rs>South</rs>, will be driven to the deepest despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341" />We doubt whether their moral sentiments are sufficiently humane to make the feeling anything like remorse or repentance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342" />They will be chagrined and disappointed to a desperate degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343" />On a large scale, their feeling will be that of the sheep-stealer caught in the fold, with the sheep on his back: the annoyance, mortification, and shame of detection or defeat, but <hi rend="italics">no repentance.</hi> They will be ever ready to return to their evil practices (though, under adverse circumstances, they may even for swear them,) when the opportunity offers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344" />They are ruthless and remorseless, and there is no hope for any <num value="1">one</num> in their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345" />Nothing but the force of resistance can defend the right against them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366" /> The writer of these lines knew the deceased in intimately for <measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure>, and during all that time not <num value="1">one</num> bitter thought or unkind word ever passed between us. Our friendship, though formed at school, where we were members of the same classes partook not of the instability of the majority of such intimacies, but instead of terminating with our school boy days, grew and strengthened with our years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367" />Our school day life afforded me an excellent opportunity of studying thoroughly his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368" />He possessed a quick and original mind, a generous heart, and an independent and fearless spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369" />I have never known <num value="1">one</num> of loftier principle or more noble affections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370" />But it were vain to attempt to portray his many viragos. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371" /> At the commencement of the war, although in delicate health, he was eager to take up arms in defence of our glorious old State, and volunteer in <num value="1">one</num> of the companies then being raised in our native town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372" />And it was not until he was told by his friends and physician that such a step on his part would be suicide, that he reluctantly relinquished the idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373" />He remained in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269" authname="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> some <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> after the evacuation by our forces, when his noble and chivalrous nature could brook no longer the insults and degradation heaped upon her defenceless citizens by the hire ling soldiery of the enemy, and he resolved to make his escape and join our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374" />He was twice fooled in this attempt, but on the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> trial was more fortunate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375" /> On his arrival at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia" authname="tgn,2112877">Manassas</placeName>, it was some time before his friends could persuade him not to join the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376" /> He left us and went to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and while there accepts a position in the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377" />This never suited his restless and sensitive disposition, and he told me often that he could hot bear the thought of returning to "<persName n="Haven,,Old Belie,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="default:Haven,Old Belie,,," authname="haven,old belie"><foreName full="yes">Old Belie</foreName> <surname full="yes">Haven</surname></persName>" without having struck <num value="1">one</num> blow to avenge her. About <num value="1">one</num> year ago he was elected a Lieutenant in <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Richmond</rs> local defence companies, and for <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> preceding his death was actively engaged in the defence of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in the outer line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378" />As was feared by his friends, he could not stand the exposure incident to camp life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379" />He was taken ill; but, being the only officer with his company, would not leave it until disease had taken so strong a hold on his constitution that, when brought to the city, his condition was such as to preclude all hope of recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380" />He was told the nature of his disease, and from his bright, cheerful countenance, during the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> that he lingered, must have known that he was dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381" />He said once, when asked by his sister how he fell, "It is all right; if I die, I will go to heaven, but I may not die yet." His last words, that could be distinguished, were, "<persName><roleName n="Lord" full="yes">Lord</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Jesus</foreName></persName>, take me home." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382" /> Thus has passed away another noble martyr in defence of our beloved country, for although not cut down by the deadly missile of the enemy, he has nevertheless sacrificed his life in her sacred cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383" />To him who now pays him this humble tribute his place can never be supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384" />Far away from home, loving friend and long cherished association, while he lived the writer left as if he had some <num value="1">one</num> to confide his sorrows, and who would aid him with his counsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385" />His mortal remains sleep in the cemetery at Holy wood, while his pure spirit is at rest in a brighter and better world. H. </p> </div4>
