<milestone unit="sentence" n="67" />We made <placeName reg="Sambro Head">Sambro Head</placeName> at an early hour, and then ran along the rocky coast towards the mouth of the harbor.--Presently we saw a small boat coming through the mist, and a cheery <name>Irish</name> voice asked if we wanted a pilot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69" />A regular branch pilot now came off to us and took the ship from the fisherman, who was only permitted to take in vessels when no pilot was at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71" />Being wet and disagreeable on deck, we saw but little of the scenery in going up the bay. Getting short glimpses through the open ports, we saw the shore was well cultivated and dotted here and there with little white villages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72" />There are also some fine farms that stretch back from the water — the green pasture lands covered with sheep and cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73" />It is <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> only to the city, and in less than an hour we were anchored off the town. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78" /> <placeName reg="Halifax, Halifax, Virginia" key="tgn,2112076" authname="tgn,2112076">Halifax</placeName> is a city of some <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79" />The houses are built principally of wood, and have an air of age, although the main portion of the town is comparatively new. Along the bay is the business portion, and back upon the hill the residences of the merchants and the military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80" />The land upon which the city is built rises rapidly from the water into a hill, crowning which is the citadel, a strong and heavily-armed fortress, protecting the town and commanding the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81" />At the present time the garrison consists of the <num value="16" type="ordinal">Sixteenth</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="17Battalion">Seventeenth battalions</orgName>, with detachments of the <orgName n="Royal Artillery" type="artillery">Royal Artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83" /><placeName reg="Halifax, Halifax, Virginia" key="tgn,2112076" authname="tgn,2112076">Halifax</placeName> is quite a business town, and stores and warehouses increase with great rapidity as the trade annually enlarges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84" />Its fine harbor gives it many natural advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85" />It would be superfluous to enter into a detailed description of the town in this diary, and I pass it by with the few remarks already made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86" /> The people generally are very friendly to the <rs>South</rs>, but in too many instances I can but think it an interested friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87" />They derive great benefit from southern trade, and, undoubtedly, are honest in their sympathy and in their admiration for Confederate valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88" />A few men can be mentioned who have done a great deal for our cause, and have shown their sympathy in something else besides empty words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89" />Among these are <persName n="Almon,Doctor,W.,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="default:Almon,W.,J.,," authname="almon,w.,j."><roleName n="Doctor" full="yes">Dr.</roleName> <foreName full="yes">W.</foreName> <foreName full="yes">J.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Almon</surname></persName>, <persName n="Slayter,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Slayter,nomatch:0" authname="slayter"><roleName n="Doctor" full="yes">Dr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Slayter</surname></persName>, <orgName><persName n="Weir,,B.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="default:Weir,B.,,," authname="weir,b."><foreName full="yes">B.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Weir</surname></persName> &amp; Co.</orgName>, <persName n="Keith,,A.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="default:Keith,A.,,," authname="keith,a."><foreName full="yes">A.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Keith</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Pillsbury,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Pillsbury,nomatch:0" authname="pillsbury"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Pillsbury</surname></persName>, editor of the <hi rend="italics">Journal,</hi> who has taken a strong stand in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93" />The archbishop, also, is very friendly to us, and his heart, his house, and his purse, have ever been open to needy Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94" />The <name>British</name> officers are unanimous in their expressions of friendship; but I notice a great change in their feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95" />Policy seems to control them, and the fear of their <name>Yankee</name> neighbors is evident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96" />I had an acquaintance in the <num value="17" type="ordinal">Seventeenth</num>, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> --, who, when I was in <placeName reg="Halifax, Halifax, Virginia" key="tgn,2112076" authname="tgn,2112076">Halifax</placeName> last winter, was very warm and open in his sympathy for our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97" />Now, I could but notice the cautions manner of his expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98" />There is a change in the feeling plainly seen, owing, probably, to the course of the <rs>Government</rs>, which grows daily inimical to us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101" />The appointees are in every instance strongly against us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106" />Early in the evening, without a word of warning, several armed boats and launches were sent down to us with orders to go to sea at once, and forbidding us to take over <num value="100">one hundred</num> tons of coal, enough, it was said, to take the vessel into the nearest Confederate port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107" />A naval officer was put on board to see that all dispatch was used, and the boats anchored alongside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108" />This was rather galling to our pride, and entirely unnecessary, for a simple order from the <rs>Admiral</rs> would have been sufficient without all this armed display. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109" /> All haste was now used to get the vessel to sea. Nearly <num value="100">one hundred</num> tons of coal was taken on board, and a small quantity of oil and engineer stores, absolutely necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110" />About dark we hauled out into the stream, and only waited the return of a guard party, sent out to look up some runaways, to go down the bay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111" />About <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> the guards returned and reported <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> men missing, evidently enticed a way from the ship by <name>Yankee</name> emissaries.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116" />Perhaps we expected too much; at any rate, despite our condition, the law, custom or sympathy, we were peremptorily ordered to sea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250" />Yet, that it is the plan which is to be tried, seems plain to us, if for no other reason than that it was the plan of last summer, which failed so egregiously.
