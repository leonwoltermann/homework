<div3 type="article" n="1" org="uniform" sample="complete"> 
<head>Provisions — prices — and Taxation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324" /> Provisions are assuredly not in sufficient abundance to justify any waste or unnecessary consumption; but that they are as scarce as the high prices demanded for them would indicate is untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325" />There are enough in the country to support the army and the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326" />The scantiness of supplies in the principal markets are owing to <num value="3">three</num> causes, viz: The holding back for higher prices by some holders; the <rs>Government</rs> impressments of shipments on the way to market at prices <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> below the rates paid by the citizen, thus alarming producers and checking consignments; and the very bad condition of the roads, entirely obstructing transportation in many localities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327" /> The extreme scantiness of supplies at the principal markets, and especially in this city, ran up the prices with amazing rapidity; and, as <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> fixed the prices or the country, they jumped up everywhere, just as they did here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328" />Every village, every cross-road; nay, every farm- house, established <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> prices, and the general fear that the <rs>Government</rs> would get the surplus on hand at lower rates, induced a system of hiding, and doling out in small lots from garrets and cuddles in a clandestine manner, to persons who would come in and go out covertly and do business more by means of knowing winks and nods than words. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329" /> Thus the constriction put upon the markets, regulating prices, roasted upon the rural districts, and the <rs>Government</rs>, seizing supplies at prices so much under the market rates, was itself out off by the hiding system from what it might have had at those rates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330" /> This mistake of the <rs>Government</rs> worked an evil with many bad effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331" />The Government ought to have governed prices for everybody, or have been itself governed by the prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332" />It is impossible to maintain <num value="2">two</num> sets; <num value="1">one</num> for itself and <num value="1">one</num> for the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333" />This has been plainly proven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334" />Had it paid the current rates, and as far as possible have allowed provisions to take their wanted route to the principal markets, prices would have been kept lower, the supplies would have been concentrated for easy distribution, and a better state of feeling would have prevailed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335" /> The law of impressment now in force will, we hope, improve the condition of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336" />It is a concession on the part of the <rs>Government</rs> as to the necessity of recognizing the prevailing rules of valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337" />It had but <num value="1">one</num> alternative to this, and that was to establish or govern prices for the whole country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338" /> The great measure, however, in the hands of the <rs>Government</rs> is that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Taxation.</hi> That is the agent with which it may lift up its own present credit, and in a great degree check the ruinous and corrupt system of extortion and speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339" />This disease, which now so seriously effects the country, and threatens to embarrass the <rs>Government</rs> not a little, requires the most energetic treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340" />It is deep seated, and the knife should follow it to the very core. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341" /> The Government, in laying its tax, should be guided not only by its wants, but by the <hi rend="italics">general standard of values.</hi> If goods and produce, and if the fabrics of mechanical industry, are <num value="10">ten</num> times their ordinary value, then why not levy the tax in like proportion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342" />So with <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>, and all kinds of personal property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343" />This is the only made of absorbing the national currency, and diminishing its redundant circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344" />This is the only mode of keeping up the <rs>Government</rs> credit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345" /> If the <rs>Government</rs> has to pay the people <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> times its value for every bushel of born or wheat or pound of bacon it buys for the army, then the people must pay the <rs>Government</rs> <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> times more revenue in the form of taxation than they ever paid before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346" />It is plain that they are entirely able to do this, and we feel assured they are perfectly willing to do it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347" /> Congress certainly cannot hesitate in a matter so plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348" />If that body will fulfill its entire duty to the country on this subject, it will not only do the greatest benefit to the <rs>Government</rs>, but to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349" />It will keep down the circulation, maintain the public credit, check speculation, and restrain extortion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350" />It will be found that there is an end to the upward movement of prices, and that <sic>that</sic> end being reached they must inevitably come down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351" />Taxation is the regulator to bring this about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352" />As long as we have a currency not convertible into gold, taxation is the only means by which these important objects can be practicably accomplished. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"> 
<head>Supplies.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353" /> The roads have greatly improved; the restrictions upon transportation are relaxed, and the <rs>Government</rs> impressment bill proposes to pay valuation upon the basis of prevailing standards for what it requires; therefore, what of surplus there is in the country ought to seek the market in good time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354" />Certainly it can secure no advantage to the holder by being kept back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355" />It can be hardly possible that prices can go higher; and if anybody dreams that they will, there is every probability that he will be signally disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356" />If holders are governed by a sound discretion, we are sure they will avail themselves of the opportunity afforded, and send what is perishable and what sells so enormously high at once to market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357" />If they act wisely, we doubt not the markets will be better supplied. </p> </div3>
