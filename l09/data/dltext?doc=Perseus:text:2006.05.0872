<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />The most important battle of the war, after that of the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first Manassas</rs>, has just been fought and won by the <rs>Confederate</rs> arms.--The result is told in a few words: There is no longer an armed enemy on the soil of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" />Only the <rs>Federal</rs> dead, wounded, and prisoners, now remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />The multitudinous host, swelling with confidence and pride, who lately invaded that powerful State, threatening to overrun her territory and devastate her homes, has been defeated and forced to seek refuge behind barricades and breast works along the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america" authname="tgn,2715022">Tennessee river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />Let every heart in all our suffering land give thanks to Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for His great kindness for this signal deliverance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" /> Having been detained on the route, I arrived upon the field too late to witness the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />I am also almost wholly uninformed of the organization of the various corps, divisions, and brigades which compose the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />Under these circumstances I am constrained to rely, in great part, upon the statements of others who were in a position to be well informed, and do not pretend to speak with absolute certainty, or to enter much into detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />But there is <num value="1">one</num> fact which may be affirmed with great confidence and emphasis, to wit: that the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops never fought better; nor did any other troops upon any other battle-field ever conduct themselves with higher courage or more distinguished gallantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" /><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0" authname="longstreet"><surname full="yes">Longstreet</surname></persName>'s veterans and <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0" authname="bragg"><surname full="yes">Bragg</surname></persName>'s braves entered into a generous rivalry, and each strove to set an example of daring and to out do the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />The <num value="1">one</num> rushed to the conflict with their old battle flags, bearing upon their ample folds the inscriptions of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> "<placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia" authname="tgn,2112877">Manassas</placeName>," "<placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933" authname="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>," "<placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia" authname="tgn,2489907">Malvern Hill</placeName>," "<placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943" authname="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>," and "<placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia" authname="tgn,7017621">Chancellorsville</placeName>," and fully resolved to wave those glorious standards in triumph over a Western, as they had already done over an Eastern, foe. The other, conscious of their own manhood, and yielding to none in high resolve and dauntless courage, yet stung by the memory of former disasters, went upon the field with their minds and hearts fully made up never to quit it but as victors, nor until they had proven to all the world that they were the worthy brothers of the heroes of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> and the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />Before men thus animated and thus resolved, many of whom (the <name>Georgians</name>) fought in view of their household gods, nothing could stand and live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />Their fierce battle cries rung out above the din and uproar of the mighty strife — the trumpet notes of victory to Confederate arms, and the knell of defeat and death to the enemy.--Great clouds of yellow dust and blue smoke from the guns and burning woods enveloped the field and the struggling combatants, and, ascending from the plains, settled upon the crests of the hills and mountains in festoons of fantastic shape; but, deep as was the gloom, there were flashing eyes there that saw through it all, and followed with a steady gaze the path that led to victory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" /> Nor were <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0" authname="bragg"><surname full="yes">Bragg</surname></persName> and <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0" authname="longstreet"><surname full="yes">Longstreet</surname></persName> insensible to the feeling which animated their followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />To them it was the last opportunity to reverse the decrees of a hit hereto unpropitious fortune; to the other it was a new field of hope and ambition, where another blow might be struck for his country, and fresh laurels gathered for his own brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />Each did his duty nobly, as did all then officers and men, and the rewards of a grateful country await them.
