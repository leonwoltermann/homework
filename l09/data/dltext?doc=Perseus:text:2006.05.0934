This of itself was a violation of that "strict neutrality" to which such hypocritical pretensions are made, if Vattel be acknowledged of any authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349" />But this was merely the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353" />In <date value="1861-04" authname="1861-04">April, 1861,</date> <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> declared the whole coast of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, from the <rs>Potomac</rs>, in a state of blockade, although, according to his own reports to Congress, the whole navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> consisted at the time of but <num value="24">twenty-four</num> vessels, of which <num value="0.5">one-half</num> were absent on foreign stations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354" />The coast thus declared in a state of blockade is between <num value="3">three</num> and <measure n="4000miles" type="distance">four thousand miles</measure> in extent, and could not be effectually blockaded by the combined navies of the whole civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357" /><persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00243" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,," authname="russell,thomas"><surname full="yes">Russell</surname></persName> himself claimed credit for having assisted the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to keep up this paper blockade, although it inflicted enormous injury on <name>British</name> trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358" />He afterwards stated that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were not in a condition to insist upon other nations acknowledging that the blockade was effectual.--Notwithstanding this positive declaration, when <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00244" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0" authname="mason"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Mason</surname></persName> called on <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00245" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,," authname="russell,thomas"><surname full="yes">Russell</surname></persName> to request the <rs>British Government</rs> to withhold its sanction from this gross violation of public law, <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00246" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,," authname="russell,thomas"><surname full="yes">Russell</surname></persName> replied that, though the blockade had not been effective some time since, it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> at that particular moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359" />He had a new interpretation, also, ready for the clause in the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00247" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0" authname="paris"><surname full="yes">Paris</surname></persName>, which says that no blockade shall be considered effective unless "sufficient to prevent access to the coast." "That clause," he said, "was directed against blockades not sustained by any actual force, or by a notoriously inadequate force, such as the occasional appearance of a man-of-war in the offing, or the like." This construction makes the declaration mean the reverse of what it said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360" />The annunciation of it is quite sufficient to prove that the <rs>English Government</rs> did not mean to be bound by it. There can be no doubt of the motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361" />Hostility to us made <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00248" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,," authname="russell,thomas"><surname full="yes">Russell</surname></persName> violate international law and his agreement with us. When we complained that all this was contrary to the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00249" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0" authname="paris"><surname full="yes">Paris</surname></persName>, and that he was injuring us by giving a respect to that blockade to which it was not entitled, he said it was quite true — and in his late speech, alluded to by us a short time ago, he states his reasons for doing so. The <rs>English</rs>, it seems, once blockaded a coast of <measure n="2000miles" type="distance">2,000 miles</measure>, and they had no right to reprehend the <rs>Yankees</rs> for doing the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362" />Now, that very blockade of which <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00250" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,," authname="russell,thomas"><surname full="yes">Russell</surname></persName> here speaks, has been acknowledged by <name>English</name> writers on public law, as well as <name>English</name> historians, to have been altogether against law, while all foreigners, without exception, denounce it as the most infamous outrage ever perpetrated upon the rights of neutral nations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363" /> Such is an outline of the masterly argument, supported by undoubted facts, by which the <rs>President</rs> proves that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has been our deadly enemy throughout this war. <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00251" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,," authname="russell,thomas"><surname full="yes">Russell</surname></persName> himself shows <num value="1">one</num> of his motives when he deprecated war with the <rs>Federal States</rs> in conjunction with these slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364" />In the affair of the iron steamers, detained by <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00252" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,," authname="russell,thomas"><surname full="yes">Russell</surname></persName> contrary to all law, public or municipal, he is quite as clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365" />Indeed, we are well convinced that were there any means of coming in contact with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, we should be bound to declare war. </p> </div3> </div2>
