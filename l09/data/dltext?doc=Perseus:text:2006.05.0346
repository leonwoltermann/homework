<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" /> It is by no means certain that it will be necessary to have any successor to those gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />In the first place, it is within the limits of possibility that through a demand of the <rs>British Government</rs>, these gentlemen may yet be released from their confinement, and placed on a British deck under the <rs>British</rs> flag, from the protection of which they were so violently and illegally taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />In that event, they can proceed on their voyage and execute their mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />It is not only possible, but, in the opinion of many competent judges, it is probable that the <rs>British Government</rs> will insist upon at least that degree of reparation to the insulted dignity of the <rs>British</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />If such a demand be made, we believe that the <rs>Yankee Government</rs> would accede to it at once, for, with all their prodigious boasting, they will never dare to provoke a war with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />At all events, till that question is determined, it is at least due to our commissioned representatives to make no new appointments, a proceeding which, moreover, would expose us to the embarrassment of having, in the event of their release, <num value="2">two</num> sets of Commissioners to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />But supposing it definitely determined that the <rs>British Government</rs> will not interfere in their behalf, it is questionable policy whether other gentlemen should be sent from this country to take their places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />There are Southern gentlemen now in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, who could perform their duties, and this without the risk which attends a voyage across the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />At all events, the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> should carefully keep its own counsels as to any purpose it may form upon this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />If it is important that we should have Commissioners abroad, it is important that we should adopt all the means necessary to the successful accomplishment of that end, and among those means, none is more essential than profound silence as to what we intend to do.--We ought to know by this time, from bitter experience, that to make public an intention of sending Commissioners, and still more the names of those Commissioners, is the surest way of defeating our own object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />The late appointments were made known, and the circumstances attending the departure of the <rs>Commissioners</rs> had as much publicity as if there were no obstacles whatever to impede their transit across the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />It is clear that if successors are to be sent, the only prudent course is not even to let it be known that there is any such intention, and especially that the names of the appointees should not be whispered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />If appointed, let them get off in profound silence, and with none of the pomp and circumstance of an ambassadorial mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />With the observance of these precautions, we may succeed in getting ministers to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, in case the <rs>Government</rs> deems such a commission necessary, of which we are by no means certain. </p> </div3>

If the blockade was really efficient, if the <rs>Federal Government</rs> had at their command a force sufficient to interdict commerce, in conformity with the received maxims of international law, we should hear nothing of the <rs>Mexican</rs> expedition as a movement justly open to suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97" />It is because the <rs>Federal Government</rs> well know that they are maintaining a blockade on sufferance, and embarrassing commerce through the forbearance of the neutral Powers, that they fear the presence in the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009" authname="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName> of a combined fleet belonging to those Powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100" />It is quite possible for the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to commit the <rs>Northern States</rs> to a collision with this country.

This, however, is perfectly consistent with the innocuous presence of the combined fleets in the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009" authname="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName>, and with the solution of the question to which the expeditionary force is subordinate.

The colossal power of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, overshadowing <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685" authname="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> on the <rs>North</rs>, and <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893" authname="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and the <name>States</name> of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> on the <rs>South</rs>, so clearly arrogated to itself the disposition of all matters on the continent of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611" authname="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, that it seems useless to interfere with the affairs of communities all destined sooner or later, to absorption in the vast and growing republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106" />If we wanted a convincing proof that the tide has turned, and that we are entering on a course of new and unforeseen events, we find it in the fact that the <num value="3">three</num> Powers who possess the coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> immediately opposite to <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611" authname="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> have entered into a convention which binds them to fit out and send a joint expedition for the purpose of demanding from the <rs>Republic</rs> of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893" authname="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> more efficacious protection for the persons and properties of their subjects, as well as the fulfillment of all obligations contracted towards them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107" />Knowing the very limited resources of which the authorities of the <rs>Republic</rs> of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893" authname="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> can dispose, the chronic anarchy which has so long wasted that unhappy country, the alternations of plunder which have wasted its wealth, and the exceedingly precarious position of whichever faction may for the moment be predominant, we do not believe that these forces go to meet any very formidable or obstinate opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108" />We do not expect that the <name>Allies</name> are about to act over again the exploits of Hernan Cortes, for they have no vast and consolidated empire to confront them, and the <rs>Mexican</rs> authorities well know that in case of resistance they are but the precursors of a force which would render resistance absurd.--We cannot doubt that the troops of the <num value="3">three</num> nations go to dictate their own terms, and that whatever these terms may be they must of necessity he complied with.
