<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" /> From the severity of the past winter we are led to conclude that the season for all crops will be a very favorable <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />It is true, not much wheat was put in the ground lest fall, owing to the long continued dry weather; but what there was planted will undoubtedly produce largely, giving nearly as much as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />But what we will lack in wheat will be more than made up in the larger quantity of corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />The farmers are preparing, in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> generally I believe, for planting as much corn as possibly can be attended to. Some of our oldest citizens and most experienced farmers say that they have never known it to fail that good crops would follow a snowy winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />If there is any virtue in snow then we have been greatly blessed, for we have had <num value="21">twenty one</num> so far and it may be we shall have more, as we have not passed the equinox. --It snows are of great advantage, our crops will be surely superabundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />I hope every farmer in the whole Confederacy may be impressed with the importance of pointing every grain of corn and every inch of ground they possibly early for, it ever there was a time when it was necessary to have corn, it will be at our next harvesting season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />It is quite as necessary as to have powder or other munition of war, and those who engage in agriculture this year will be doing as much service to the country as if they were under arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />The scarcity of hands, however, will be a great draw back, and it may be that a suspension of the <name>Conscription</name> law until after the harvest, in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, would not be impolite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />However, that is a matter for the consideration of those in authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" /> The subject of impressments by military officers is attracting much attention, and there is no doubt that, as heretofore carried out, it has operated much to the injury of the <rs>Government</rs>, and has borne harshly upon portions of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />If the <rs>Congress</rs> will declare there shall be no more impressments, and agree to enter the market as a purchaser, upon an equal footing with private individuals, they will soon be enabled to get all they need at less rates than they are compelled to pay even by impressments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" />Entering into a fair competition, they will have all the advantages of the market; and the market will be better supplied, because people will no longer be deterred from putting their produce into market for fear of Government impressment agents.
