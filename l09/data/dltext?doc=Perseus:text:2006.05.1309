<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />To Arm and Equip an Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to be hold by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" />But it should be remembered that arms are now required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />I therefore urge all persons not in the service to deliver promptly, to some of the officers designated below, such arms and equipments (especially those suitable for cavalry) as they may have, and to report to those officers the names of such persons as neglect to surrender those in their possession. </p>
