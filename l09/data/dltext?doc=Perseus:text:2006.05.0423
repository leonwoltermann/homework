<milestone unit="sentence" n="61" /> This new gunboat is a long, wide, and flat-bottomed vessel, with vertical sides and pointed ends, requiring but a very shallow depth of water to float in, though heavily loaded with an impregnable armor on her sides, and a bomb-proof dock, on which is placed a shotproof revolving turret, that will contain <num value="2">two</num> very heavy guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62" />She is so low in the water as to afford no target for an enemy, and everything and everybody is below the water line, with the exception of the persons working the guns, who are protected by the shot-proof turret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63" />To give the upper portion of the vessel the proper powers of locomotion, there is suspended beneath it another <num value="1">one</num> of less strength, sufficiently narrow and sloping at the sides, that if the enemy's balls should pass below the shot-proof upper vessel these sides can only be hit at such an angle that not harm shall ensue, and in its length approaching the bow only so far that its raking stem may receive the shot fired from directly ahead in the same way, and at the stern giving sufficient space to permit the shot coming from directly aft to pass under the shot-proof end without hitting the rudder, which is abaft the propeller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64" />The sides of the vessel are <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> formed of plate iron, half an inch thick, outside of which is attached solid white oak <measure n="26inches" type="distance">twenty-six inches</measure> thick, outside of this again is rolled iron armor <measure n="5inches" type="distance">five inches</measure> thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65" />The bomb-proof deck is supported by heavy braced oak beams, upon which is laid planking <measure n="7inches" type="distance">seven inches</measure> thick, covered with rolled plate iron <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure> thick. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66" />The turret consists of a rolled plate iron skeleton, <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure> thick, to which are rivetted <num value="2">two</num> thicknesses, of <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure> each, of rolled iron plates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67" />Outside of this again are <num value="6">six</num> plates of rolled iron, all firmly bolted together with nuts inside, so that if a plate is started it can be at once tightened again.--The top is covered with a bomb-proof roof perforated with holes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68" />The lower part of the gun carriages consists of solid wrought-iron beams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69" />These are planed perfectly true, and are placed parallel in the turret, both of the guns pointing in the same direction.--The ports through the side of the tunnel are only large enough to permit the muzzle of the gun to be thrust through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75" />The officers' quarters are very roomy and handsome, and are ventilated and lighted by openings from the deck. </p>
