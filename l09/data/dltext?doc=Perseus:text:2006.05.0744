<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9" /> The Yankee raid, which has made so much soles and done so little, has had its effect in guarding alarm in certain sections which contribute largely to the daily markets of the cry. Added to this is the apprehension of danger of impressing horses and, the <num value="2">two</num> <unclear /> operating, supplies have been, within a few days, very much curtailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" />As the raiders have gone, and as pressing is suspended — as the occasion and the action under it are passed — they can all come now in quiet and safety and get war prices for, their marketable commodities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" /> The number to be fed, especially those needing fresh food — vegetables and meat — is much increased, and therefore the demand is greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />Those who have seasonable supplies will find quick sales, and may return safe and satisfied. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2" org="uniform" sample="complete"> 
<head>The season food for stock.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" /> The season is backward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />The trees have been unusually late in donning their foliage. --There have been such frequent and heavy rains as very much to interfere with the labors on the farm, and to delay the planting of the corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />But, while the season has thus retarded some operations of the agriculturist, he has been compensated with an abundant growth of green food for stock at a time when forage is scarce and unprecedentedly high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />At no time in our experience has the earth borne a heavier crop of verdure than at this time, and it is indeed a Godsend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />Nor will any serious injury result from any delay caused by that condition of the season so propitious to the grasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />Corn, in our genial climate, will mature in good time even when planted after the middle of <dateStruct value="-06-" full="yes" authname="--06"><month reg="06" full="yes">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />So there need be no fears for that crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />On the other hand, both wheat and oats are looking admirably well, and the promise of an abundant crop was never better at this period of the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />The breadth of land occupied by the grain crops will be uncommonly large, and, though too early to speculate upon the yield, it is gratifying to behold the favorable condition of all growing crops at this time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" /> The abundance of grass must have its effect in diminishing the demand for forage, and tend to reduce the exorbitant prices that have prevailed. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />Never before were they so inflated with gas and bombast — never so excessively rollicking and riotous in their precision of resplendent victories and a "crushed rebellion!" Even the "officers of Government," so often and so sorely tried in their labors of reforming broken and defeated armies, are said to have been "especially good natured" at the news of the crossing, and "seemed to think the people [Yankees] will take this as another proof of the determination and ability of our rulers [Lincoln and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0" authname="seward"><surname full="yes">Seward</surname></persName>] to push on rapidly toward <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>."

In short, the whole of Yankeedom seemed to have gone mad with joy under the delightful prospects of ending the rebellion and taking possession of all the wealth and good things of the <rs>South</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />In <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0" authname="hooker"><surname full="yes">Hooker</surname></persName> they beheld another <persName><foreName full="yes">Gideon</foreName></persName>, who was invincible.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" /> How will they receive the news of their reverses after these follies, these absurd boasting and extravagant expectations, such as could be indulged no where on earth but amongst that peculiar people who inhabit the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />But they are great at the art of dissimulation, and may change their tune with as much facility as the organ grinder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138" />A large army, an immense number of iron clad at a mere, gunboats, and fighting craft of all kinds, assembled after long preparation, were dispatched for the capture or destruction of that cradle of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139" />But if the <rs>Federal</rs> preparations were formidable, those of their opponents were not less so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141" />The year which has elapsed since the reverses of last spring roused the <rs>Confederates</rs> to more energy, and measures have been employed to make the chief points in the <rs>South</rs> as defensible as possible, even against the new engines of warfare which Federal ingenuity has devised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154" />But here, also, the magnitude of the enterprise is equivocal to a Federal reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155" />It is, of course, possible, that, by a regular investment, a succession of bloody battles and a delay of army makes or <unclear /> <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023" authname="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> may be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156" />But when such immense exertions are necessary to effect to little, what must we think of the final object of the war.--the conquest of the <rs>Southern States</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157" />The South seems to accept a trial of strength at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023" authname="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, bent on conciliating the <rs>Western States</rs>, will do its utmost to win, a victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158" />But, suppose <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023" authname="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> to be taken, what then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159" />To talk of such an exploit as "opening" the <rs>Mississippi</rs> is to make a confusion between military and commercial ideas.
