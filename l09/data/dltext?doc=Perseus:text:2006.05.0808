<head>The <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129" authname="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName> news.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9" /> The telegraph has been unusually silent for the last day or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" />Apparently, it thinks the work of last week entitles it to a short holiday and really we are very much of that opinion ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />The last news it gives us from <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129" authname="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName> is encouraging, as far as it goes, but the public taste has been so highly stimulated of late by accounts of wholesale slaughter in pitched battles and the surrender of entire armies, that it will scarcely endure any narrative which deals with less than <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6000">six thousand</num> corpses and an equal number of captives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />A few years ago, when we thought <placeName key="tgn,2044460;tgn,2016605;tgn,2036878" n="0.136 000000.8181 placename;tgn,2044460;bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;0.091 000000.5454 placename;tgn,2016605;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;0.045 000000.2727 placename;tgn,2036878;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America" reg="bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America" authname="tgn,2044460;tgn,2016605;tgn,2036878">Bethel</placeName> a great pitched battle, and the carnage of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia" authname="tgn,2112877">Manassas</placeName> not <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to the carnage of <placeName reg="Waterloo, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2753461" authname="tgn,2753461">Waterloo</placeName> this narrative would have electrified the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" />But the taste for blood prows with indulgence, and men become every day more like wolves, as they give way to the growing appetite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />We should much rather have heard that <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> had been slain than that a poor, paltry <num value="1000">thousand</num> had bitten the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />If men accuse us of Lycanthropy for expressing such a sentiment, we care not a farthing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />We are getting savage, with the rest of our countrymen, and we confess to a special delight in hearing of piles of <name>Yankee</name> corpses, no matter how high or how broad, or how long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />For prisoners we have not the same weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />They are troublesome to guard, and must be fed. But dead men attempt no escapes, create no disturbances, sat no bread, cost no money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />We had rather hear of <measure n="100000" type="dead">one hundred thousand dead</measure> <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> than of <num value="1">one</num> single <name>Yankee</name> prisoner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" /> There is but <num value="1">one</num> thing in this telegram which is displeasing to us. It is the little sentence "The Yankee wounded and dead were still lying in front of our entrenchments." --There is an awful <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023" authname="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> twang throughout this sentence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />When we read it we seem to be carried back <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, and to have before the works of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023" authname="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> the attacking <orgName>army of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0" authname="grant"><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName></orgName> and the defending <orgName>army of <persName n="Pemberton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,John,C.,,:1" authname="pemberton,john,c."><surname full="yes">Pemberton</surname></persName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />It will be recollected with what unction the telegraph rolled the sweet morsels under its fiery tongue — how it told of piles of <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> lying dead before our works — how it discoursed of the horrid stench exhaling from their petrifying carcases — how we were continually repelling the barbarians and reddening the earth with their gore — how with scarcely a change of tone, it suddenly told us that <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023" authname="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was fallen, that its garrison were prisoners, that all its gallantry and all its pertinacity had been vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />We think of all this, and we shudder when we read of the slain and wounded lying in front of our works.--Let us, however, hope for the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />This is, at any rate, a good beginning, and if it be pushed to a conclusion, that conclusion may be the fortunate event of our political life — the turning point in the great drama of this unparalleled Revolution. </p> </div3>

<head><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s proclamation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" /> We invite the particular attention of all whom it may, or may not, concern, to the proclamation of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:2" authname="davis,jefferson"><roleName n="President" full="yes">President</roleName> <surname full="yes">Davis</surname></persName>, to be found in another column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />We are glad to see the promptness with which the call of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> for <num value="300000">300,000</num> fresh troops has been met. That functionary, like all his subjects, believes that everything can be done by force of numbers, and that to be efficient an army need only be big. Nothing can cure him of this delusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />During this war he has called into service, successively, <num value="75000">75,000</num>, <num value="300000">300,000</num>, <num value="500000">500,000</num>, and <num value="1000000">1,000,000</num> men, and yet he is no nearer the end of his enterprise now than he was in the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />He has been met at every turn by the undaunted spirit of a free people, and they have shown to the world, though they have not succeeded in convincing him, that such a spirit a proof against all odds, and superior to any force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />He is about to try the same experiment once more, and we doubt not with the like measure of success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" /> This proclamation will enormously swell the rank and file of our army, and swell it with the best possible material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />From <num value="40">forty</num> to <num value="45">forty five</num> man is in the prime of his existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />He still retains all his strength and the greater part of his activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />He is cooler, calmer, and better, understands what he is fighting for than the young recruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />He understands the rights for which he is contending, and prefers death to defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />We wish the <rs>Constitution</rs> had extended the time to <num value="16">sixteen</num> and <num value="50">fifty</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" /> We appeal to all Southern men to come forward at once, without waiting for the enrolling officer, and enroll their names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />To stand back now is to cover themselves with shame, which the lapse of time can never erase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />Besides, it will answer no good purpose, for the enrolling officers will not over look a man. All must be brought out, for the country wants their services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />A great boon is offered in the alternative of selecting the company to serve with, or be conscripted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />Few men of spirit will hesitate even for a moment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" /> To arms!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />to arms!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />fellow-citizens — form yourselves into battalions, into regiments, into brigades!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />The enemy is in your country, burning and ravaging at his will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />Let us teach him a lesson he will never forget. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3" org="uniform" sample="complete"> 
<head>The case of the <rs>Alexandria</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" /> The decision of the <orgName n="British Court" type="court">British Court</orgName> in the case of the <rs>Alexandria</rs>, puts an end to <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0" authname="adams"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Adams</surname></persName>'s operations, through his spies, peering and paying into every <name>British</name> ship-yard to ascertain if there were any ships building for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" />The decision gives perfect liberty to every ship builder to build as many ships as he pleases for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48" />It will highly irritate the <rs>Yankees</rs>, but the <orgName n="English Court" type="court">English Court</orgName> fortified itself by the highest Federal authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49" />It sustained its decision by citing the opinion of <persName n="Story,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Story,nomatch:0" authname="story"><roleName n="Judge" full="yes">Judge</roleName> <surname full="yes">Story</surname></persName>, who "laid it down that, although by the terms of the <rs>Foreign Enlistment</rs> act a neutral State was prescinded from equipping or arming vessels for the purpose of aggression against a friendly power they were not precluded from equipping and arming them for the purpose of sale to any <num value="1">one</num>, belligerent or otherwise, who chose to purchase them." This, the <rs type="place">Court</rs> as named, authorized a neutral to equip a ship of war just as he may construct a cannon, if he intends not to use or have it used against a friendly power, but merely to sell it; and he might even sell it to either of the belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50" />But in the case of the <rs>Alexandra</rs> the question was not as "to arming and equipping," the testimony only proving the "building of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51" />The jury gave a verdict for the defendants very promptly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52" /> The <rs>Yankees</rs> will be greatly incensed, and their ire will be not at all diminished, by the quoting of their best authority on the subject it will rather increase their indignation — they will look upon that as the using of their own stick to break their heads with — a sort of adding insult to injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53" />They care nothing for authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54" />They are only intent on the prosecution of their present purpose — the wreaking of their revenge upon the <rs>Southern</rs> people; and anything that helps to thwart them is outrageous, and, come whence it may, is an evidence of hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55" />So that the <rs>English Government</rs>, for allowing the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to obtain arms, munitions and ships — although <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> they have the same opportunities, the same liberty, and have availed themselves of them — is an enemy to Doodledom, and is doing what can be done to injure it and assist the <rs>Confederates</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56" /> We shall soon see the <rs>Yankee</rs> press railing at the <rs>English</rs> for this decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57" />We have already the bitter <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432" authname="tgn,2080432">London</placeName> letter, in the <orgName n="Philadelphia Inquirer" type="newspaper">Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi></orgName>, which pronounces the whole matter of the prosecution a farce, declaring that the decision was a "foregone conclusion," and "precisely what <persName><roleName n="Earl" full="yes">Earl</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Russell</foreName></persName> and <persName><roleName n="Lord" full="yes">Lord</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Palmerston</foreName></persName> intended it should be." The writer concludes: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58" /> "It is well, I say, that we at last see <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> in her true colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59" />Her intentions are now apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60" />Henceforth her ports are open, and her ship yards at the service of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61" />Her ship builders may construct, openly, as many vessels as they choose for the <rs>Southern</rs> navy, only, for a time, they must probably be careful not to put their armaments on board actually in an English port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62" />It is likely, however, that this restriction will also become a dead letter in a few weeks." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63" /> The writer thinks these tidings should not only excite the "utmost indignation" at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, but it should at once cause the <orgName n="U. S. Naval Force" type="org">United States naval force</orgName> to be increased by the "addition of an unlimited number of privateers," and he suggests that our ships built and building in the <rs>English</rs> yards are fine prizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64" />Why don't the <rs>Yankees</rs> take those that are afloat? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65" /> It is agreeable to hear the <rs>Yankees</rs> railing on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66" />Let them fill the sea with privateers, what are they to do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67" />We have no commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68" />Are they to rob generally?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365" /> When an officer is on active service in the field, everything connected with the daily life of his men should be an object of constant attention; no detail is beneath him. He must not think the arms and ammunition his most important charge, and that if they be in fighting order he need not trouble himself much about the rest. </p> </q></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366" /> The arms are the fighting weapons, but the soldier is the machine which wields them; and it is to him — to clothing his back, and feeding his belly, and looking after his health and comfort — that the great attention is due. The arms and ammunition must of course be always in perfect order; but they are only required when in contact with an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367" />The natural condition of soldier on service is the line of march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368" />He will have at least <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure> marching to <num value="1">one</num> of fighting; and he has to be preserved in health and comfort during these <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure>, otherwise his musket and pouch would do small service on the <num value="21" type="ordinal">twenty-first</num> day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369" /> An officer should go among his men, and himself look after their comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370" />No fear of their losing respect for him because be does so. At the end of a march, he should never feel at liberty to attend to his own wants until he has seen his men engaged is cooking their meals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371" />The rapidity with which a regiment has its fires lighted after a march, and meals cooked, may be regarded as a test of the attention paid by the officers to the comfort of their men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372" /> Similarly before a march, an officer should take care that none of his men leave their encampment or bivouac without as good a meal as circumstances permit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373" /> As regards equipments for the field, an officer must have as few wants as possible, and he should carefully study the art of putting up the articles it is necessary he should possess in the smallest possible compass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374" />The line of march must be considered as the natural condition of a soldier, and everything regulated with that view. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375" /> An officer charged with the arrangement of any military movement or operation, should on no account trust to the intelligence of subordinates who are to execute it. He should anticipate and provide against every misconception or stupidity it is possible to forces, and give all the minute directions he would think necessary if he knew the officer charged with the execution of the operation to be the most stupid of mankind. </p> </div3>
