So, it seems, this is all that the poor negro gets from his new masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276" />He is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pushed forward upon the most dangerous service that can possibly be required of a soldier — he takes the bullets and bayonets which his better disciplined white comrades should receive — he acts as a living rampart to shield them from danger — and when he is compelled, by a fire which no troops on earth could stand, to break and run, he gets nothing but curses and jeers in return for his devotion! --This is <name>Yankee</name> all over, and is the attempt to prove that, had the place of the negroes been filled by white regiments, the event would have been different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277" />There is nothing in the history of "The Army of the <rs>Potomac</rs>" to prove the truth of this assertions or to show that the best of its white troops would not have been beaten quite as effectually as were the unfortunate negroes, whom they forced into their ranks in spite of their wishes and remonstrances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278" /> This trial of the negro, however, seems to have effectually dispelled the last illusion with regard to the services expected from that race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279" />Before the war commenced, the <name>Abolitionists</name>, totally mistaking the character of the negro, and the condition in which he existed, were constantly in the habit of representing him as an oppressed captive, ready to take vengeance upon his oppressors at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> signal of a liberating army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280" />The most glowing pictures were drawn of midnight murders and conflagrations; of huge slaves brandishing axes and torches; of Southern women and children massacred upon their hearthstones, or fleeing to the woods for safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281" />The negro was represented as the very incarnation of the fabled <rs>Nemesis</rs> —— the <rs>Avenger</rs> of the wrongs of whole generations — the <hi rend="italics">Fate</hi> of the unfortunate white race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282" />The progress of the war soon dissipated all these idle imagining. --Except in a very few instances, the negro manifested no hostility whatever to his master, for the simple reason that he had never been oppressed, as the <rs>Yankees</rs> presumed he had been — presumed so because, if they had been in his master's place, they would have wrung the last possible exertion from his tortured limbs — and that he had nothing to avenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283" />Thus they got rid of <num value="1">one</num> delusion, only to fall into another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284" />The negro, from the very law of his origin in a tropical climate, is indolent, and will not work if he can avoid it. He is, moreover, ignorant, credulous, and peculiarly open to temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286" />They will follow it through field and forest, through bog and mire, to the end of the world. --Having become aware of this, the <rs>Yankees</rs> have employed this expedient with astonishing success.--A band in any neighborhood is sufficient to attract <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the negroes from all the plantations in <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287" />Other temptations were added; and thus <num value="1000">thousands</num> have been tolled off from homes better and happier than they will ever see again; and this circumstance gave rise to the greatest delusion of all; namely, to the belief that the negroes could be made soldiers of. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288" /> The negro is patient, enduring, and by no means vindictive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289" />He is, naturally, a respecter of authority, and is the most acute person in the world in distinguishing the <hi rend="italics">real</hi> gentleman from the pretender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290" />Neither fine clothes nor fine airs can impose upon him. He knows a gentleman by instinct, and he respects him though he be in rags, while he has no respect, for the vulgar pretender, though clad in purple and fine linen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291" />But he cannot be made a soldier of, especially by the <rs>Yankees</rs>, for whom he has no respect and whom he cannot be induced to treat otherwise than as an equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292" />He knows that a white man ought not to put himself on a level with him, and he despises him for doing it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295" />About a year before the war began, <persName n="Hickman,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Hickman,nomatch:0" authname="hickman"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Hickman</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710" authname="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, declared, in a speech, "<num value="18000000">18,000,000</num> can beat <num value="8000000">8,000,000</num>."

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303" />They have called into the field <num value="2800000">2,800,000</num> troops, and have actually put in <num value="1800000">1,800,000</num>, according to their own showing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304" />They have run themselves in doubt to the tune of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305" />They are everlastingly boasting of their honor and their determination to wipe us out of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306" />And yet, with all these advantages, they have been compelled to call for help on the poor negro — to tear him from his home and force him into the ranks — to put him forward as a living rampart for their white troops — to teach him war cries which they know must add <num value="10">ten</num>-fold to his dangers — to see him slaughtered without mercy, and without daring to reinforce him. It is the most shameful, the most humiliating, picture ever presented by a nation to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307" />And yet the <rs>Yankees</rs> boast of it — absolutely glory in their own shame — so utterly destitute are they of all the feelings which ennoble man and tend to redeem what is least commendable in his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308" />They cease not to boast, though the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, everywhere successful, stands to give the lie to their vain-glory; for what a poor, pitiful, miserable set of poltroons, and liars, and braggarts, must compose that nation, when it is not able, with all its advantages, even backed by our own negroes, to reduce us to submission! </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388" />Concurring with the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> in the paramount importance of obtaining, at the earliest practicable period, an ample quantity of wheat for the support of the army, we apprehended, as so great a disparity existed between our former rates and the rates then offering in our leading cities, that unless we advanced prices our action might seriously embarrass the government in their efforts to obtain immediate supplies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389" /> Under these circumstances, and owing to the very short crop of wheat and unprecedented demand for breadstuffs, together with the depreciation in the currency, as well as to the further fact that the farmers were then securing the oat and hay crops, we proposed the advanced prices set forth in our <dateStruct value="-07-" full="yes" authname="--07"><month reg="07" full="yes">July</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct full="yes"><month full="yes">August</month></dateStruct> schedules. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409" /> in assessing the average value of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery and wagon horses and mules at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> We designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common sense import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410" />In other words, that they should be selected, and then impressed according as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the commissioners when they assessed the average value of such horses as the government needed at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>; but cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that <hi rend="italics">all</hi> horses at hand should be impressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411" />Yet, under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses, or brood mares of <hi rend="italics">admitted high value</hi> are impressed, We respectfully suggest to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi> in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horses or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class wagon mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412" /> the terms average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413" />We supposed that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or <num value="1">one</num> individual, that some might be estimated at <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure>, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure>--thus making an <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value or price <hi rend="italics">for a number</hi> of good, sound, and efficient horses or mules <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414" /> in illustration of our views, We will add that a horse with only <num value="1">one</num> eye sound might, in all other respects, be classed as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, yet the loss of <num value="1">one</num> eye would justly and considerably curtail his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415" />So a horse from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, but, of course, however efficient, or able to render good service for a year or so, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416" />Any horses, however he may approximate the standard of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fall below the maximum price; and as few comparatively come up to the standard, and, therefore, are entitled to the maximum price, so of course in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced as imperfections place them below the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, &amp;c. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438" /> Since the adoption of our schedules for the months of <dateStruct value="-02-" full="yes" authname="--02"><month reg="02" full="yes">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct full="yes"><month full="yes">March</month></dateStruct>, the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439" />At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was in a few days thereafter to be taxed <num value="33">thirty-three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>- <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440" /> The <orgName n="State Board" type="board">Board of State</orgName> Commissioners having adjourned, and <num value="1">one</num> of its members being out of the <rs>State</rs>, it could not be convened in time to review our schedules of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441" />Under this state of facts, we have re-examined and re-arranged our tariff of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing in this mode to render any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442" />Therefore, we assure the <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value of artillery for wagon horses or mules, impressed since the passage of the currency bill of the <dateStruct value="-02-17" full="yes" authname="--02-17"><day reg="17" full="yes">17th</day> <month reg="02" full="yes">February</month></dateStruct> last, at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>. This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation, accordingly as each horses or mule presently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing agents and officers should forth with call on all of these persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a settlement upon the foregoing basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443" />But allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our average appraisement, <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>, as a fair medium valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444" />This, then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">$800</measure> and a minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">$400</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure> the average price — thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class horses or mules, and proportionately less for the inferior, as they may fall below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446" /> The impressing officers in those instances where there were no arbitrators or local appraisements for homes or mules impressed, should in all such cases themselves re-estimate the value of horses or mules thus impressed, and allow in each case such additional compensation as would, within the limits of our schedule rates, appear just and proper.
