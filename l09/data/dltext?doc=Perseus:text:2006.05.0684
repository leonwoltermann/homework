<milestone unit="sentence" n="83" />Some reason required to be assigned to the <name>Portuguese</name> authorities for the <num value="290">290</num> having anchored in the bay, and accordingly the excuse furnished to them was that her engines had broken down.

During this interval, large parties of the inhabitants of Tarissa made daily visits to the <num value="290">290</num>, their curiosity evidently excited by the warlike appearance of what laid claim to be an English merchant vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85" />Many pertinent questions were asked by the <name>Portuguese</name>, and were as ingeniously evaded or met by the officers of the <num value="290">290</num>.--Among other things, the <name>Portuguese</name> wanted to know why the vessel had so many ports, and were told that, as she was bound to a warm climate, they were necessary for ventilation; and when they asked why there was such a numerous crew, the reply was, that as she was going on a surveying expedition she required to be well manned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86" />Many similar questions were put, and in like manner answered; but it was all in vain to attempt to undeceive the <name>Portuguese</name>, and they would persist in calling her a "<term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Inglesi</rs>." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87" /> About the lapse of a week from the arrival of the <num value="290">290</num> the bark above mentioned sailed in and anchored, her <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> alleging as a reason to the <name>Portuguese</name> officials that his vessel had sprung a leak, which would require to be repaired ere she could resume her voyage; and on this understanding the <name>Portuguese</name> at once placed her in quarantine, (which in the <rs>Azores</rs> lasts <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>) On the day after the bark's arrival <persName n="Bullock,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="mostcommon:Bullock,nomatch:0" authname="bullock"><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Captain</roleName> <surname full="yes">Bullock</surname></persName>, of the <num value="290">290</num>, being anxious to get his guns on board, hauled alongside the bark, and erected a pair of large shears to effect the transfer of her cargo from the bark's hold to the <num value="290">290</num>'s deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88" />This brought off the <name>Portuguese</name> in a fury that their rules should have been broken by the <num value="290">290</num> having dared to communicate with a vessel that had still <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> quarantine to run, and they angrily demanded to know the reason why their regulations had been infringed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89" />They were told that the bark was in a sinking condition, and the erection of the <unclear>shea</unclear> was accounted for by urging the necessity of an immediate temporary transfer of her cargo, that the leak might be reached and stopped, and <persName n="Bullock,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Bullock,nomatch:0" authname="bullock"><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Captain</roleName> <surname full="yes">Bullock</surname></persName> finally succeeded in bearing down all opposition by feigning to get in a passion, saying he was doing no more for the bark than any Englishman would do for a countryman in distress.
