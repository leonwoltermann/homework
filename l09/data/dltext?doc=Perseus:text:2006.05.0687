<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296" /> This is a repetition of the old game of bragg.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297" />The <rs>Yankees</rs> from the beginning have been playing that game, and have been "pulverizing the <rs>Confederacy</rs>" till we wonder there is a whole pebble left in it from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande Whilst</rs> it would be suicidal to underrate their numerical superiority, it would be equally impolitic and preposterous to give them credit for all the pretensions to overwhelming strength which it suits them to set up. They professed at <num value="1">one</num> time to have nearly a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298" />We do not believe they ever had half that number; or, if they had, it matters not how many such men are arrayed under their banners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299" />As if that multitude was not sufficient, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> called months ago for <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301" />If they were ever raised, what have they ever done, except suffered repeated and bloody repulses?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302" />The <num value="3000000">three millions</num> will never come, and the only material effect of the <name>Conscription</name> law — probably the only <num value="1">one</num> intended — will be to retain in their present army the men whose term of service expires in the spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303" />Those armies will have to be whipped before we can expect any relaxation of its insane purpose of subjugation by the <rs>North</rs>, and when they are disposed of the process of pulverization will be indefinitely postponed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305" />We do not believe that the <orgName n="U. S.

We shall encourage no such hopes in the <rs>Southern</rs> mind; for they will only be destined to disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311" />Ever since we have ceased to look abroad for succor, and have trusted in heaven and in our own strong arms rather than in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, we have gained fresh strength and success.
