<milestone unit="sentence" n="148" />He was utterly insensible, and there was a dreadful wound in his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149" />Both limbs were crushed hopelessly beneath the horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150" />He was utterly beyond the reach of human skill to save, but as soon as possible I had him conveyed to the hospital.
