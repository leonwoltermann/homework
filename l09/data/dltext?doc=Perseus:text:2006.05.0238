<milestone unit="sentence" n="60" />I had to put up with the same solitary covering, and a <rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet bag</rs> for a pillow, at the <rs type="place">Junction</rs> "Hotel" on a former occasion, the night previous to my leaving <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia" authname="tgn,2112877">Manassas</placeName>, where I went to witness a rencontre that did <hi rend="italics">not</hi> come off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61" />I should have luxuriated on the green sward as much as the spicure who courts the yielding softness of a downy couch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62" />While my bed was preparing I turned out of tent, and perched myself on the garden fence, where I smoked my meerschaum like a philosopher, meantime ruminating on the eventful <hi rend="italics">stampede</hi> of the <q direct="unspecified">"Grand Army"</q> (<num value="7">7</num>) on the previous <rs>Sunday</rs>, and anon <q direct="unspecified">"watching the flight of bodies of light;"</q> although unlike the sage in the song, keeping midnight vigil, there was no danger of my mistaking lustrous feminine orbs for their sister spheres!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63" />Soon <num value="1">one</num> of Afric's sons announced the pleasing intelligence that <q direct="unspecified"> "all was ready."</q> So, having grown tired of abstractions, I shook out the ashes from my pipe, and, leaving the stars to romantic lovers, proceeded to my quarters Here, to my surprise, within a comfortable tent, I found a camp bedstead and a very cozy bed indeed, prepared for my reception, with nothing worse than a few big flies to "murder sleep, " which, like most evil doers, seemed to dread the light, for they took refuge in the apex of the marquee, and evidently felt uneasy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64" />Having undergone the troublesome operation of undressing — thanks to our civilization, which necessitates many other inconveniences — I folded my garments and placed them on the foot of my bed, as chairs and wardrobes are luxuries not appurtenant to camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65" />I had only just reclined, and was upon the point of falling into the embraces of <persName n="Morpheus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Morpheus,nomatch:0" authname="morpheus"><surname full="yes">Morpheus</surname></persName>, when, with a sharp, harsh sound that almost set my teeth on edge, I found my support going from under me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66" />it was too bad. The canvas at <num value="1">one</num> side of the bedstead had taken summary leave of the tiny nails that attached it to the timber frame-work; so I had no small difficulty in maintaining my equilibrium during the night, which I managed to accomplish by a number of "strategic movements" probably not known before in military experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67" />This camp bedstead had, to all appearance, never been used before, but it was now fairly "used up." Oh, you peccant, recreant military contractors of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, or any other place, who supply goods such as are warranted to <hi rend="italics">look well,</hi> but not to <hi rend="italics">wear;</hi> your heads ought to be exacted as the penalty for your peculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68" />I, for <num value="1">one</num>, should not scruple with my own hands to make triangular gibbets of your camp bedsteads, and hang every mother's son of you without the benefit of clergy! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69" /> Next morning I arose rather early — although not quite with the lark — I wonder what time this model bird goes to roost?--and took as extensive an ablution as was possible, considering that no bath rooms or bath apparatus are attached to camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70" />I accomplished the troublesome routine of the toilet, too, without the aid of a <rs n="looking glass" type="product">looking-glass</rs>--a feat which would have been <hi rend="italics">death</hi> to a woman!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71" />If ever Southern women should turn Amazons, and take up any more formidable weapons than their own arms and tongues to stay the inroad of the enemy, trust me a mirror is a luxury they will not dispense with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72" />After sniffing the morning air for a while, and enjoying the quiet beauty of the landscapes — for Nature in these regions appeared as calm as if the din of battle had never disturbed her serenity — breakfast was announced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73" />For those like myself, who are accustomed to take their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meal in bed, there is a particular charm in "going down to breakfast; " but it is a charm nevertheless which diminishes with its frequency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74" />The General and his staff were all present at table; so after interchanging no end of "good mornings, " I set to heartily in renewing my exhausted physical powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75" />Although the table did not groan beneath the weight of luxuries, as I have seen tables groan in the <rs>Federal</rs> camps, still there was a plenteous supply of necessary comforts; a fact which I gladly record for the benefit of Northern journalists, and they are welcome to make whatever use they please of the information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76" />After this simple but substantial repast was over, <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0" authname="beauregard"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Beauregard</surname></persName> sent written instructions to his "Aid," <persName n="Chisholm,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Chisholm,nomatch:0" authname="chisholm"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Col.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Chisholm</surname></persName>, (a very excellent fellow, by the way,) to take me over the battle-ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77" />For this purpose the <rs>General</rs> had kindly placed his private ambulance at my disposal; but as I was informed that such a conveyance could not possibly travel to some spots of interest on the field, owing to the absence of proper roads, nothing was left but to make "a virtue of necessity," and go on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78" />Now, this was a kind of exercise to which I had not been accustomed; for my ambition in this way never reached higher than a mule's back; and my equestrian experience was hitherto entirely confined to scaling a few <persName><foreName full="yes">Swiss</foreName></persName> mountains, and journeying from <placeName key="tgn,7005688" n="1.000 2" reg="torino,torino,piemonte,italia,europe" authname="tgn,7005688">Turin</placeName> to the summit of Superga — the tomb of the <name>Sardinian</name> kings — on the species of quadruped I have mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79" />At length a pretty little nag was saddled for my use — a quiet, docile creature, warranted not to run away with its rider, or indulge in eccentricities with its hind legs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80" />So I mounted the animal and made a tentative attempt at horsemanship, although with some degree of misgiving, I confess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84" />Sometimes as I passed stray groups of citizen soldiers, I fancied that they took particular notice of my awkward horsemanship; but I consoled myself by the reflection that they were but novices in military experience, as I was in the new art to which I aspired. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86" />Here my reflections became solemn — for horror gives horrent shapes to thought — and the enormity of our civil war seized upon my mind with absorbing force — an internecine war for which there was no necessity, and <num value="1">one</num> which has thrown all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> into surprise and commotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88" />It was not long ere I arrived upon the spot where the mighty action was fought, which has shed glory on the <rs>Southern</rs> arms, and will give an European <hi rend="italics">prestige</hi> to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> that perhaps it could not otherwise, or at least so readily, obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89" />The country which a short time before had been so luxuriantly beautiful, now appeared desolated. --Rich corn crops had been trodden down and destroyed by the enemy's cavalry, while exuberant grass-fields had been upturned as if a plough share had been driven through them The ruts made by wagon-wheels were perceptible everywhere, and everything showed that a terrible conflict had lately taken place.--Dead bodies of the enemy, too, lay about in all directions, the intense heat of the sun rendering them intolerable to approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95" />Although in the presence of death — and death so inexpressibly terrible to behold!--the sight of the shoes and stockings (and even more indispensable articles, needless to particularize,) was too much for my risibility to resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96" />Imagination vividly conjured up the "Grand Army" divesting themselves of these slight and even necessary encumbrances, in order to facilitate their flight; which, no doubt, was accelerated by the impression that <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0" authname="beauregard"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Beauregard</surname></persName>, by some Faustic skill, had <q direct="unspecified">"masked batteries in the air!"</q>--an idea which is the <rs>General</rs>'s, not mine!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108" />I am credibly informed that the wounded Federalists in our hospitals frequently weep, owing to the uniformly kind manner in which they are treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109" />It seems, I fear, a prevalent idea with the enemy that Southern soldiers are destitute of the common feelings and amenities of humanity, and that no quarter need be expected should the for tunes of war place them at their mercy.--<q direct="unspecified">"Kill me, if you like,"</q> observed a wounded man to <num value="1">one</num> of our soldiers, who approached him as he was lying helpless on the field--<q direct="unspecified"> "Kill me, if you like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114" />In yonder little cottage dwelt an aged poor woman and her daughters, who surely thought that no <num value="1">one</num> would injure her. She was shot in her bed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115" />Observe that farm house on the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116" />It looks very unpretentious, and is plainly indicative that the owner is but a struggling man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117" />I regret that I have mislaid the man's name whose residence was thus ruthlessly violated and rifled; but he is known about the headquarters of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0" authname="beauregard"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Beauregard</surname></persName>, where I have conversed with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120" />The luncheon formed a portion of the manubrial stores abandoned during the precipitate flight of <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, and consisted of preserved tripe — a very delicious dish, I can assure you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121" />I cannot well tell how it was I so liked that tripe!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122" />Human nature is an heterogenous amalgamation — a combination of incongruities — an incomprehensible mass of conflicting elements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123" />Was the delicious flavor I experienced an intrinsic component of this palatable, luxurious dish?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124" />or was it simply or partially produced by the quaint satisfaction I experienced in the knowledge how it had been procured?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125" />Verily, I cannot answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126" />All I know is, that I enjoyed it infinitely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131" />I did so after a little, and was perfectly horrified upon beholding the sacrilegious manner in which a building devoted to the worship of the <name>Omnipotent</name> had been desecrated and polluted by the enemy, who had evidently been quartered there on the night previous to the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132" />There can be no palliation for such a crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133" />I do not believe that an army of invading barbarians would have thus violated the religious feelings and sentiments of the human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134" />Several of our soldiers and some civilians were in the sacred edifice when I entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135" />I found every portion of the walls covered over with writing, even to those of the vestry, while such portion of the calling as could be reached from the pulpit and gallery was also defaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136" />For the most part, the calligraphy consisted of simple signatures and flourishes with dates; but in several cases I noticed extensive sentences, grossly abominable expressions in large characters, and the most, disgustingly obscene figures drawn on the walls and the woodwork of the gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137" />The very neighborhood of the altar was not respected; for in close proximity to it I read the words <q direct="unspecified">"Death to Traitors — thus saith the <rs>Lord</rs>!"</q> together with a cartoon representing <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:Davis,David,,,:3" authname="davis,david"><roleName n="President" full="yes">President</roleName> <surname full="yes">Davis</surname></persName> suspended by the neck, illustrated by the sententious sentence, <q direct="unspecified">"J.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200" />This does not seem to arise so much out of any conviction that the successful prosecution of the war is hopeless, though that is no doubt a question with many; but sober reality has taken the place of frenzied excitement, and the character, cost and best possible result of the war are things which enter into the calculations of reasonable men.
