<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />The enemy, comprising <num value="3">three</num> companies of cavalry, <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery, and more than a regiment of infantry, had formed to receive the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />The <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> charged them, when their cavalry took to immediate flight; but their infantry, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> <persName n="Maryland,,Yankee,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Maryland,Yankee,,," authname="maryland,yankee"><foreName full="yes">Yankee</foreName> <surname full="yes">Maryland</surname></persName> regiment made a determined stand, and the conflict for some time was fierce and bloody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />After the rout was complete, and most of the prisoners captured, others came up and assisted in taking prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />Owing to the difficulty in crossing the bridge at <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870" authname="tgn,2111870">Front Royal</placeName>, which had been set on fire by the enemy, it was difficult for the cavalry to cross the river, which accounts for so small a portion of the cavalry being in the fight.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" /> Having noticed in several of the <orgName n="Richmond Papers" type="newspaper">Richmond papers</orgName> communications concerning the battles near this place of the <dateStruct value="--07" full="yes" authname="---07"><day reg="7" full="yes">7th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="--8" full="yes" authname="---08"><day reg="8" full="yes">8th instant</day></dateStruct>, and seeing that they are denominated the battles of Crose Keys and <placeName reg="Lewiston, Androscoggin, Maine" key="tgn,7013885" authname="tgn,7013885">Lewiston</placeName>, I beg leave to call the attention of the public, through the medium of your widely circulated journal, to a few facts and events which will entitle this place to the honor of having been the theatre upon which was enacted those glorious achievements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />As you are pressed for space and prefer short communications to lengthy ones, I shall be as brief as possible, and without further preliminary remarks give my reasons for believing that the recent battles fought near this place should be entitled the <q direct="unspecified">"Battles of <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715" authname="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName>." </q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" /> In the first place, <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129" authname="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s army had retreated to this place, the long trains of baggage wagons and prisoners had passed safely over the bridge, and the firing commenced immediately on the banks of the river opposite the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />The enemy were driven back by degrees until they reached the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Union Church, Jefferson, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057675" authname="tgn,2057675">Union Church</placeName>, where the hottest of the contest ensued, about <placeName><distance reg="2.5miles" full="yes" exact="U">two and a half miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715" authname="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName></placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" /> In the second place, the enemy's cavalry dashed into town, surrounded the house that they supposed was the headquarters of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:1" authname="jackson,stonewall"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Jackson</surname></persName>, and demanded his surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />They were immediately fired upon and driven away faster than they came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />Many of the houses in town have bullet holes through them, and several of them had cannon balls and shells shot through them; and in several places the fences are completely riddled with grape and canister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />Also, many pieces of shell have been picked up in various parts of the town, all going to prove conclusively that those battles should be entitled the battles of <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715" authname="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89" />We make some extracts: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90" /> It must be kept in mind that, under the most favorable circumstances — the immediate repudiation of the blockade, supported by a competent naval force to sweep every blockading vessel from the <rs>Confederate</rs> coast — the supplies of cotton must still continue for many months to be scant and dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91" />Nature has arranged for the <rs>Southern States</rs> a business season which man cannot invert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92" />As the staple matures, the rivers, without which cotton lands are of little value, begin to rise; and during the long harvesting of the crops — the so-called picking season — bale after bale, in small lots, so soon as ready for the market, are placed on board the fleet of steamers which swarm on every navigable water course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93" />At the same time the seaport cities become healthy, and admit of the immigration of a large white laboring class from the <rs>North</rs>, who are indispensable to the proper and prompt disposal of the crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94" />Thus the picking, ginning, baling, transportation, and sale of the cotton are so nearly simultaneous that when the last bale is picked on the plantation, the business season in the seaport is already drawing to its close. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95" /> Contrast with this the conditions under which the crop of <dateStruct value="1861--" full="yes" authname="1861"><year reg="1861" full="yes">1861</year></dateStruct> is to be moved, should the ports be opened during the summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96" />The rivers are low, and navigable only for boats of the lightest draught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97" />Of such boats no new ones have been built for the trade, as is usual even in ordinary seasons; but a great many have been converted to warlike purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98" />The cotton lies unpinned on the plantations, and though a bountiful supply of gunny bags and iron ties from this country may, in a measure, remove this difficulty, these supplies must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reach the planter are the cotton can be made ready for shipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99" />Suppose all these obstacles removed, whence shall come the necessary labor at the seaport?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100" />The class which always supplied it — even if it could endure the fatal summer heats, and the yellow fever, was banished from the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> coasts — now composes the bulk of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies.

<head>The Grand conflict.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337" /> The reader was informed yesterday morning of the beginning of that great struggle which will have a more decisive effect upon events to come than any and probably all the battles that have yet occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338" />The armies opposed were the largest ever brought in conflict on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339" />Ours made the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340" />It was in the highest degree gratifying to our citizens to know with what spirit and success on our side this momentous conflict begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341" />It was continued yesterday, with what result we are out fully informed when we write; but we are confident that victory crowned the gallant deeds of our brave soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342" />Our news column will give the reader the fullest details possible to obtain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343" /> The great battle was conducted and, we suppose, planned, by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Sydney,S.,,:1" authname="lee,sydney,s."><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName>, and we anticipate it will win for that distinguished officer lasting honor and fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344" />He had the co-operation of some of soup very best <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, who, too, will have their honors and their place in the nation's gratitude. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345" /> Never was battle inaugurated more suspiciously — never was attack made with more irresistible ardor and bravery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346" />Some of the charges upon the enemy's powerful batteries on their <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> would have gilded the brightest pages of military history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347" />There could be nothing in war more intrepid and dauntless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348" />The enemy was compelled to abandon his strong positions and leave them to the possession of our heroic volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349" />The enemy's right was fortified on chosen positions, approached only from gradually ascending and wide plains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350" />These our soldiers traversed at a double-quick in the face of a hail storm of death, and reaching the breast works, passed over them in pursuit of the fleeing enemy, in many cases turning their own guns upon them with effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351" />The charge upon the powerful and extensive battery at <placeName reg="Ellerson's Mill">Ellerson's Mill</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147" authname="tgn,2112147">Hanover</placeName>, which look place yesterday morning, must be <num value="1">one</num> of the most brilliant achievements of the conflict for the capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352" />It is noticed in the news column. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353" /> We cannot now go fully into a reference to the plan of the grand attack; but we are confident it will end in the defeat of the powerful army brought to take this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354" />If this confident belief — justified by the success thus far, and the completeness of the plan of our operations — should be realized, a great change will take place in the relations of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to the world — a great change must be wrought upon the extravagant calculations and preparations of the unscrupulous and relentless despotism of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355" />But let us await the issue before speculating further, and let us pray to the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Battles for His protection and favor to our brave troops in their grand struggle for honor and right. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618" />Under these circumstances, it is their duty to put forth their power with whatever of energy may be at their command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619" />A large portion of the <rs>Western</rs> and Northwestern parts of the <rs>State</rs> has been in the occupancy of the enemy, and though there are as warm and as loyal hearts there as in any part of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, yet, from this untoward circumstance, they have been able hitherto to do but little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626" />A recital of a few of these acts, which are undeniable, will suffice for justification in the eyes of the world: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627" /> The course they pursued previous to the war was more than sufficient to justify our separation from them; but their disgraceful violations of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and of plighted faith since the war; their utter perversions of truth; their reckless disregard of justice and of the rights of property, and their departure, in numerous instances, from the usages of civilized warfare; the invasion of our homes and the murder of our peaceful citizens, render a connection with them in future odious to our sense of honor and abhorrent to our feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628" />It has produced an estrangement as enduring as if there was an impassable gulph between us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629" /> The Constitution, as they interpret it; the contempt of its provisions, according to their own interpretation; the laws made in conformity with it, and those in direct conflict with its plainest provisions, which are equally approved by them; the men who have been the instruments to execute their power and vengeance, and the hirelings who have pillaged our land, desecrated our churches, polluted our fair fields, sacked our towns, and insulted the innocent and helpless, render them alike detestable to us and disgraceful to humanity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630" /> They were bound by the <rs>Constitution</rs> to guarantee to us our rights, and protect us against invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631" />They have invaded us themselves, with the avowed object to subjugate and overwhelm us, to confiscate our property and banish us from our domain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632" /> They were required to give no preference by any regulation of commerce or revenue to the ports of <num value="1">one</num> state over those of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633" />They have shut up all our ports and prohibited us from having intercourse with themselves or the nations of the earth, while they have left all of their ports open to the commerce of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634" />They have refused to permit us to obtain with our own means even the medicines necessary for our sick and wounded — articles never hitherto considered contraband by any civilized nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635" /> They were prohibited from forming or erecting a new State within the jurisdiction of any other State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636" />They have permitted an illegal Legislature, not acknowledged by the <rs>Constitution</rs> or laws of this State, or by a majority of our people, to profess to establish a new State within the jurisdiction of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, acknowledging the acts of the <rs>Governor</rs> of that State, receiving its Representatives and <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> into the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> without the color of law, justice or right, and paying for their pretended services out of the public fisc.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637" />They have granted to this pretended Governor money which they have acknowledged to be due to the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638" />They have authorized the raising of troops within this pretended State to war against our people and desolate the firesides of their brethren, and stimulated them to bloodshed and massacre. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639" /> They have allowed vacancies in the <name>Representation</name> of this State to be filled by writs issued by the false Executive of this pretended State, against the express provision that the <rs>Executive</rs> authority of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> alone shall issue such writs, with the full knowledge on their part that the rightful Governor of this State had been undoubtedly and constitutionally elected by a majority of the entire population of the <rs>State</rs>, before the commencement of the war, and that he still continues in office under his regular appointment, and in which election the people of this pretended State participated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640" />They have permitted such Representatives to be elected by soldiers in the army, and not by people in the district, against an express provision in the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, which prohibits soldiers in the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from voting in such elections, thus recognizing the base traitor against his own State as a fit associate and colleague for Representatives who are entitled to the station, and allowing low pretenders to the position of <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> to be dignified with that honorable distinction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641" /> They were prohibited from making any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642" />They have sent their myrmidons into churches and dragged our ministers from the sacred desk for a mere omission to put up a petition to the <name>Almighty</name> for their execrated <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643" />They have shut up our places of worship for the same cause, and prohibited our people from assembling together for the exercise of religious duties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644" /> They were denied authority to abridge the freedom of speech or of the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645" />They have recklessly imprisoned private citizens, holding no office or position, civil or military, for expressing a mere difference of opinion with themselves, and for fearlessly uttering their sentiments; and even incarcerated our honorable women for similar cause, permitting their armed jailors to watch and insult them in the privacy of their cells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646" />They have placed the press of the country, wherever their power extends, under censorship, and in numerous cases prohibited the circulation of papers, broken up their forms, and scattered their types to the winds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647" /> They were restrained from infringing the right of the people to keep and bear arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648" />They have disarmed large portions of the people of <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> still in their Union, and hunted and baited those in others who have presumed to keep their own arms against their mandate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649" /> They were expressly prohibited from quartering soldiers in any house, without the consent of the owner, and not even in time of war but in a manner to be prescribed by law. They have not only thus quartered them, but they have instigated their soldiers when so quartered to plunder them of every valuable, and wantonly to destroy what their cupidity could not carry away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650" />They have not only shot down helpless owners who ought to have been reverenced for their age and sex, but have consumed the owners and their dwellings in <num value="1">one</num> undistinguished conflagration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651" />And when they have professed to pay for property illegally obtained, they have paid the owners in pretended money, which they have previously criminally counterfeited and debased. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652" /> It was expressly provided that no person held to service or labor in <num value="1">one</num> State under the laws thereof, escaping into another, should, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but should be delivered upon claim of the party to whom such service or labor might be due. And yet they have openly instigated our slaves to escape, hold them by the power of the military arm, establish a commissariat for their subsistence, and give authority to their hypocritical priests and canting females to provide for their education and their temporal and spiritual welfare, perpetrating wholesale robbery and depriving owners of property guaranteed to them, in order to inculcate their fallible and uninspired doctrines into </p> <milestone unit="column" n="7" /> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653" /> the minds of their miserable and deluded victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654" />They have taken from their owners such property without a pretence of compensation, and in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName> liberated all the slaves, pretending to allow a mere pittance for their value and for that pittance have given promise to pay provided the owners, at the end of the war, should prove loyal to their odious Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655" /> With this catalogue of violations of solemn constitutional obligations, well may we say they keep no faith, and pervert truth, justice, and right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656" /> When, in the history of civilized nations, has not been known that non-combatants, plain citizens, engaged only in farming pursuits, were imprisoned for having shown allegiance to their own State laws When has it been known that wives and pure and spotless maidens have been violated by soldiers without an effort on the part of their officers to pursue the perpetrators with the vengeance of the law. What civilized nation would not blush to conceal its own flag, the emblem of its nationality and honor, and hoist on the battle field the flag of an enemy in order to decoy that enemy into a murderous fire, and then glory in the meanness of the deception and the cowardice of the act? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657" /> What ancient or modern nation ever used a flag of truce to decoy an enemy in battle other than the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658" />Let history record the disgrace and brand the infamy upon their brew for all time to come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659" /> What ancient or modern nation would openly fire upon a public hospital, in which the sick, the wounded, and the dying, are being cared for by the generous and the kind-hearted, the surgeon and the <rs>Sister</rs> of Charity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660" />We brand it as a crime upon the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and call upon the historian to record it against them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661" /> They were required to guarantee to every State a Republican form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662" />Wherever their armies have obtained a foothold, they have established a military government and appointed military satraps and provosts martial to execute laws never sanctioned by the people or the government which they created, and have executed <unclear> trary</unclear> power, enforcing it by bayonets and at <unclear> th,</unclear> months of cannon, these military rulers issuing proclamations insulting to the people unknown <unclear /> civilization and brutally disgraceful, compelling obedience by presenting the alternatives of submission or starvation, and by their mere military order, causing some of our most patriotic citizens to be ignominiously hung upon a charge of treason without trial and without law! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663" /> Can any people be expected to submit to such wrongs?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664" />Will the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> tamely submit to such tyranny?
