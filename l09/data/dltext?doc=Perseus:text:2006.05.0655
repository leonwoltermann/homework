<milestone unit="sentence" n="9" /> The news from the armies in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943" authname="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> for the past <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> has been exceedingly meagre, and even rumors with reference to the respective forces have been unusually scarce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" />By the train last night we were unable to obtain anything which looked to the probability of another attempt on the part of the enemy to recross the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />Everything was reported quiet up to noon yesterday, with no new development of the operations of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0" authname="burnside"><surname full="yes">Burnside</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" /> In the early part of the day yesterday it was asserted positively that a dispatch had been received from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Gen,,,:1" authname="lee,gen"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName> at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> that the enemy were crossing the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113716" authname="tgn,2113716">Port Royal</placeName>, but on inquiry late last evening we were assured that no such dispatch had been received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" /> The general impression is that their army has been withdrawn to the <rs>Potomac</rs> — whether to take transports for some other locality to pursue their inward to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> journey, or to go into winter quarters around the <rs>Federal</rs> capital, can only be conjectured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" /> The report that the <rs>Yankee</rs> army has again changed commanders since the recent severe battle so <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943" authname="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> is renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />The force that visited the <rs type="place">Court House</rs> was under the command of <persName n="Naglee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Naglee,nomatch:0" authname="naglee"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Naglee</surname></persName>, and consisted of a whole brigade, including infantry, artillery and cavalry.--Their general appearance was that of the better class of troops, but their conduct proved that the heart of a Yankee cannot be estimated by his exterior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />They supplied themselves very freely with liquor at several places in the county, got uproariously drunk and discharged their firearms at harmless barn yard fowls, doubtless under the impression that they were tainted with rebel sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />But perhaps the greatest destruction of property at any <num value="1">one</num> point was at a locality known as <q direct="unspecified"> "The <rs>Dragon</rs>."</q> near the line of <placeName reg="Middlesex, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002667" authname="tgn,1002667">Middlesex county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />There was an extensive tannery at that place, owned by <persName n="Reed,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Reed,nomatch:0" authname="reed"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">a Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Reed</surname></persName>, which supplied the people of the surrounding country with leather, and it so happened that the amount on hand at the time of the visit was very large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />The <rs>Yankees</rs> loaded a wagon with the valuable material and took <num value="2">two</num> of <orgName n="horse"><persName n="Reed,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Reed,nomatch:0" authname="reed"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Reed</surname></persName>'s horse</orgName>s to draw it away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />They then piled up all that remained, with the tanbark which was found in abundance, and net it on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />At the usual exportion prices of leather, it is said, the quantity destroyed would amount to over <measure n="30000dollars" type="currency">$30,000</measure> worth. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" /> The long-looked for signal guns pealed forth about <time value="5oclock">5 o'clock</time> on the morning of the <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num>; the brigade was quickly formed, and awaited orders, all full of hope and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />Here we remained a few hours, when we changed our position to the left of the plank road, somewhat nearer town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />We staid in this position all day, being somewhat exposed to the fire of the enemy's artillery, which was directed is <num value="1">one</num> of our long range batteries planted near us; but their shot did us no harm, striking the top of the hill, and ricochetting over us, or else passing over our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />After dark we resumed our former position, where we remained until the morning of the <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" />Meantime the enemy had kept up a continuous roar of artillery along the line endeavoring, under the shelter of the guns, to throw their pontoon bridges across the river, which they succeeded in doing on the <dateStruct value="--12" full="yes" authname="---12"><day reg="2" full="yes">12th</day></dateStruct>, although they were repulsed several times, with considerable loss, by our small picket force, stationed in the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48" />On this day we moved back to our <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> position and remained there, listening to the whise of ball and the bursting of shell all day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49" />The fire of the enemy on this day was unusually severe, as we were exposed to a direct line of fire as well as being enfiladed right and left, being placed, as it were, at the apex of a triangle formed by the enemy's <num value="3">three</num> lines of fire.--On this day a Yankee brigade, supposed to be <persName n="Meagher,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Meagher,nomatch:0" authname="meagher"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Meagher</surname></persName>'s, charged our batteries several times, but were repulsed with immense slaughter by our batteries and pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50" />About the middle of the day the <rs>Yankee</rs> army sent up a balloon several times, and ascertained our position very satisfactorily to themselves, as they soon succeeded in getting our range, and we lay exposed to a most galling fire of sht and shell for about <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>. <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the <dateStruct value="--14" full="yes" authname="---14"><day reg="14" full="yes">14th</day></dateStruct>, found the battalion, <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> and <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num>, in the same position in the rear of the batteries, and the <num value="16" type="ordinal">16th</num>, with <orgName type="company" n="Company G">companies G</orgName> and <orgName type="company" n="Company F">F</orgName>, of </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2" />

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53" />About midnight a detail was made from the brigade for the purpose of throwing up rifle pits, connecting with the batteries on the top of the hill, which was accomplished in perfect safety, being disturbed but once by firing of the advance pickets, which took place just as we arrived at our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214" /> Accounts received here of yesterday's <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">battle at Fredericksburg</rs> leave no question that it was the most terrific artillery combat ever fought in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215" />An officer of high rank, who was witness of the spectacle, states that the number of pieces of ordnance employed on both sides amounted to several <num value="100">hundred</num>, and under such circumstances it cannot be doubted that the list of casualties is very large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216" />But little of the battle was actually seen, by reason of the dense smoke that enveloped the whole field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217" />It is only known in general that the <rs>Union</rs> troops fought with all the odds immensely against them, and that, crowded into a narrow space which gave the enemy's guns most deadly effect, with a deep river on <num value="1">one</num> side and the hostile fortifications on the other, they maintained the unequal fight with unflinching heroism till night closed upon the scene and terminated the terrible combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218" />At this point the advantage on the whole rested with our army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219" />The accounts which are permitting to reach the public are <unclear> agre</unclear> and confused, and the result is differently estimated, as the witnesses differ in temper and desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220" />Your correspondent has conversed with numerous parties, of equal opportunities for judging, but whose opinions are widely apart, and has been able to learn the general information in possession of Government, and the conclusions of our highest military authorities, and he believes, from a careful collection of the facts at hand, that the result, if not all that we can desire, is still such as in no sense to justify the evil auguries which it has caused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221" />Only a portion of our troops were engaged, or could be, for want of space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222" />They are in the best of spirits, and entirely confident of success when the battle shall be renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223" />That it was not renewed to day is probably owing to the near approach of the reserves, which can successfully turn the enemy's left flank, and co-operate in a victory not only made certain, but less bloody, than could have resulted in a continuance of operations on the front alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224" />We may set down the action of Saturday as a reconnaissance in force, and confidently count, if our troops can be so disposed that they can generally be brought into action, on a decisive success to-morrow, or whenever the strength of the army can be brought to bear on the enemy. </p> </q></cit> </div4>
