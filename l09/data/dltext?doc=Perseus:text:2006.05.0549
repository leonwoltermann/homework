<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />These passions have changed the character of the hostilities waged by our enemies, who are becoming daily less regardful of the usages of civilized war and the dictates of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />Rapine and wanton destruction of private property, war upon non-combatants, murder of captives, bloody threats to avenge the death of an invading soldiery by the slaughter of unarmed citizens, orders of banishment against peaceful families engaged in the cultivation of the soil, are some of the means used by our ruthless invaders to enforce the submission of a free people to foreign away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />Other measures now in progress will be submitted hereafter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" /> In inviting your attention to the legislation which the necessities of our condition require, those connected with the prosecution of the war command almost undivided attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48" /> The acts passed at your last session intended to secure the public defence by general enrollment, and to render uniform the rules governing troops in the service, have led to some unexpected criticism that is much to be regretted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49" /> The efficiency of the law has been thus somewhat impaired though it is not believed that in any of the <name>States</name> the popular mind has withheld its sanction from either the necessity or propriety of your legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50" />It is only by harmonious as well as zealous action that a Government as new as ours, ushered into existence on the very eve of a great war, and unprovided with the material necessary for conducting hostilities on so vast a scale, can fulfill its duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51" />Upon you, who are fully intermed of the acts and purposes of the <rs>Government</rs>, and thoroughly imbued with the feelings and resentments of the people, must reliances be placed to secure this great object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52" />You can best devise the means for establishing that entire co-operation <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> of the <rs>State</rs> and Confederate Governments which is so essential to the well being of both at all those, but which is now indispensable to their very existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53" /> And if any legislation shall seem to you appropriate for adjusting differences of opinion, it will be my pleasure as well as duty to co-operate in any measure that may be devised for reconciling a just care for the public defence with proper deference for the most scrupulous susceptibilities of the <rs>State</rs> authorizes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54" /> The report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> will exhibit in detail the operations of that department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55" />It will be seen with satisfaction that the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> securities remains unimpaired, and that this credit is fully justified by the comparatively small amount of accumulated debt, notwithstanding the magnitude of our military operations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56" /> The legislation of the last session provided for the purchase of supplies with the bonds of the <rs>Government</rs>, but the preference of the people for Treasury notes has been so marked that legislation is recommended to authorize an increase in the issue of Treasury notes, which the public service seems to require. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57" /> No grave inconvenience need be apprehended from this increased issue, as the provision of law by which those notes are convertible into <num value="0.08">eight percent</num>, bonds forms an efficient and permanent safeguard against any serious depreciation of the currency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58" /> Your attention is also invited to the means proposed by the <rs>Secretary</rs> for facilitating the preparation of these notes, and for guarding them against forgery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59" />It is due to our people to state that the manufacture of counterfeit notes exists within our limits, and that they are all imported from the <rs>Northern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60" /> The report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, which is submitted, contains numerous suggestions for the legislation deemed desirable, in order to add to the efficiency of the service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61" /> I invite your favorable consideration especially to those recommendations which are intended to secure the proper execution of the <name>Conscript</name> law, and the consolidation of companies, battalions and regiments, when so reduced in strength as to impair that uniformity of organization which is necessary in the army, while an undue burthen is imposed on the treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62" />The necessity for some legislation for controlling military transportation on the railroads, and improving their present defective condition, forces itself upon the attention of the <rs>Government</rs>, and I trust you will be able to devise satisfactory measures for attaining this purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63" /> The Legislation on the subject of general officers involves the service in some difficulties which are pointed out by the <rs>Secretary</rs>, and for which the remedy suggested by him seems appropriate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64" /> In connection with this subject, I am of opinion that prudence dictates some provision for the increase of the army in the event of emergencies not now anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65" />The very large increase of forces recently called into the field by the <unclear />of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, may render it necessary are after to extend the provisions of the <unclear>Cen</unclear> so as to embrace persons between the <unclear /> of <num value="35">thirty-five</num> and <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure>. The vizor and efficiency of our present forces, their <unclear>co</unclear> and the skill and ability which distinguish their leaders, inspire the belief that no further enrollment will be necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66" />But a wise foresight requires that, if a necessity should be suddenly developed during the recess of Congress requiring increased forces for our defence means should exist for calling such forces into the field without awaiting the re-assembling of the legislative department of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67" /> In the election and appointment of officers for the <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">provisional army</orgName>, it was for be anticipated that mistakes would be made, and incompetent officers of all grades introduced into the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68" />In the absence of experience, and with no reliable guide for selection, Executive appointments, as well as elections, have been sometimes unfortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69" />The good of the service, the interests of our country conquer that some means be devised for withdrawing the commissions of officers who are incompetent for the duties required by their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70" />And I trust you will find means for relieving the army of such officers by some mode more prompt and less wounding to their sensibility than the judgement of a court-martial. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71" /> Within a recent period we have effected the object so long desired of an arrangement for an exchange of prisoners, which is now being executed by delivery at the points agreed upon, and which will, it is hoped, speedily restore our brave and unfortunate countrymen to their places in the ranks of the army, from which, by the fortunes of war, they have been, for a times, separated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72" />The details of the arrangement will be communicated to you in a special report, when further progress has been made in their execution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73" /> Of the particulars concerning the operations of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, you will be informed by the <rs>Secretary</rs> in his report and the accompanying documents. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74" /> The report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> embraces the operations and present condition of this branch of the public service, both a float and ashore, the construction and equipment of armed vessels at home and abroad, the manufacture of ordnance and ordnance stores, and the establishment of workshops and the development of our resources of coal and iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75" />Some legislation seems essential for securing crews for vessels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76" /> The difficulties now experienced on this point are fully stated in the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s report, and I invite your attention to providing a remedy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77" /> The report of the <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster General</rs> discloses the embarrassments which resulted in the postal service from the occupation by the enemy of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231" authname="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, and portions of the territory of the different States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78" />The measures taken by the department for relieving these embarrassments as far as practicable, are detailed in the report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79" />It is a subject of congratulation that during the <measure n="10months" type="date">ten months</measure> that ended on the <date value="03-03" authname="3-03">3d of March </date> last the expenses of the department were largely decreased, whilst its revenue was augmented, as compared with a corresponding period, ending on the <date value="1861-06-30" authname="1861-06-30">30th June, 1861</date> when the postal service was conducted under the authority delegated to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p>
