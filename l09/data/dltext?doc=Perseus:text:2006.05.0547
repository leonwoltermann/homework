<milestone unit="sentence" n="54" />Exhortations to persevere, to send reinforcements, to deliver the <rs>Federal</rs> army from its difficulties, to avenge the dishonor of its flag by a triumphant entry into <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, have, of course, been plentiful, but, as to anything further, there is a dead and most portentous silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57" />All was joy and ignorant confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58" />Now the truth is revealed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108" /> The following account of the brutalities committed on the <name>Tappings</name> by the <name>Imperialists</name> is from the pen of an Englishman who was present, in company with both <name>English</name> and <name>French</name> officers and soldiers, at the execution by disembowelling of Taping prisoners: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109" /> I went with the crowd to see the execution of the <name>Taping</name> prisoners that had been given up for execution into the hands of the <name>Mandarins</name> by the <rs>French</rs> and <rs>English</rs> authorities; or, what is the same thing, they took no measures to prevent the ruthless butchery of those they lent their aid to capture, when, horror of horrors, how am I to describe the dreadful scene, or will it ever leave my memory?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110" />Among these wretches were young and old of both sexes, and of all ages and sizes, from the infant recently born to the man of <num value="80">eighty</num>, tottering on his staff; from the <hi rend="italics">enciente</hi> woman to the young maiden from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="18">eighteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111" />The latter were pushed out by the guards among the crowds of ruffians assembled, and were taken into the sheds and by places and debauched, and again dragged back by the hair of the head to the <name>Chinese</name> guards, to await their turn for execution.--Some of them had fainted, and were pulled along the ground to the executioners, who threw them on their backs, fore off their clothes, and ripped them from the lower part of the abdomen to their breasts, which were cut off and dashed with a curse, in their faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112" />The bowels, as a matter of course, gushed out; but the cut was made in such a way, and so skillfully, and with such expertness, that the intestines were seldom injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113" />After a long time in this state of excessive torture, the executioner thrust his hand into the chest and tore out the reeking heart, his victim looking him in the face all the while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114" />A young female, apparently about <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> pregnant, who never uttered a groan or sigh at all the previous cruelties she had endured from the surrounding mob, had her infant cut out of her womb and held up in her sight by <num value="1">one</num> of its little hands, bleeding and quivering, when at the sight she gave <num value="1">one</num> heartrending, piercing screech, that would have awakened pity in a tiger, and, after it had been in that state dashed on her breast, she, with a last superhuman effort, released her arms from those holding her down, and clasped her infant to her bleeding heart and died, holding it there with such force that they could not be separated, and were thus thrown together on a pile of other carcases. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115" /> Another young woman among the prisoners awaiting her turn to be disembowelled, with a fine boy of <measure n="10months" type="date">ten months</measure> old, crowing and jumping in her arms, had him snatched suddenly away from her, and flung to the executioner, who plunged the ruthless knife into his tender breast before the mother's eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116" />Infants but recently born were torn from their mother's breast and disembowelled before their faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117" />Young, strong men were disembowelled, mutilated, and the parts cut off thrust into their own months, or flung among the admiring and laughing crowd of Chinamen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118" />But no more — I can write no more of these scenes; I can now only regret forever that I looked on the dreadful sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288" />It will have many important measures to discuss and to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289" />Let us hope that discussion will be limited and <sic>decison</sic> quick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290" />This is no time for talking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291" />The crisis demands, if ever crisis did demand, the brief, but possible consultation and the most decided action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292" /> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most important measure to be decided is connected with the conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293" />That law is manifestly imperfect, and demands immediate revision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294" />The <rs>Yankees</rs> have already called for an addition of <num value="600000">600,000</num> men to the forces they already have in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295" />The order for resorting to a draft went into operation on <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Friday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296" />There can be no doubt that the men will be forthcoming at very short notice, and that unless Congress act at once, and with the utmost energy, we shall be taken at a disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297" />We trust in Heaven that the experience of last year may not be thrown away upon that body, and that it will take such measures as to render the recurrence of such disasters as we then experienced an impossibility for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298" />To do so they must put into the field a force as large as that of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299" />That this can be done, by calling out all the conscripts between the ages of <num value="35">35</num> and <num value="45">45</num>, and by extending the list to <num value="16">sixteen</num> on the <num value="1">one</num> hand and <num value="55">fifty-five</num> on the other, and that, too, without any very great inconvenience to the agricultural interest of the country, we think it quite evident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300" />Youths from <num value="16">sixteen</num> to <num value="18">eighteen</num> are, in general, fully as able to carry a musket as they ever become afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301" />If there should be especial cases where such ability does not exist, there should be special exemptions to suit them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302" />The general law would not be affected by such exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303" />For the rest, a man <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> old is, in general, as strong, though not perhaps as active, as a man at any other age whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304" />Although he may not be able to double-quick it with younger men, yet there are many duties which he can perform just as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305" />Battalions of men of that age might be placed in all the garrisons, thereby releasing younger men for field duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306" />They can serve heavy guns, and even <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName>, as well as younger men. But, above all, there is no reason on earth why they should not serve as drivers and as cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307" />We are sure the <rs>Government</rs> could find employment for <num value="100000">100,000</num> such men, without making them serve as infantry, where the youngest and most active alone should be employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308" />And they would leave thereby <num value="100000">100,000</num> young men to serve in the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309" />We think, too, that old men might be employed in the public offices entirely with great advantage to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310" />It would give whole battalions of young men an opportunity, which no doubt they eagerly desire, to serve their country in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311" />We hope the <rs>Government</rs> will take this view of the subject and begin the work at once. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312" /> If the measures here proposed be followed out rigidly, we can put into the field a force quite equal to that called for by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>, in numbers, and superior in every quality that goes to the making up of a good soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313" />We can get our conscripts into place quite as soon as he can get his, and instead of disaster and defeat, such as marked the winter of <num value="61">61</num>-<num value="62">62</num>, we may calculate on pushing the victories that have attended our arms of late, to their most remote consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314" />But, above all, let Congress act with decision and at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315" />They have no time to lose, for the cool weather is rapidly approaching, and the ranks of the enemy are rapidly filling up. We trust they will not be delayed by the dream of intervention, which some of our contemporaries find it so hard to awaken from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316" />There is less cause to expect any interposition from abroad now than there ever has been from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318" />The <name>English</name> people are no doubt favorable to us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319" />Besides, at this moment, she is alarmed about <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685" authname="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, which she fears she will lose in the event of a war. The <rs>Arabia</rs>, which we were told was to bring out the welcome news of recognition, has come, and she brought out, instead, news of the debate in Parliament on the <rs>Canada</rs> question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320" />We trust there will be no more of these humbugs.--They have cost us enough already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321" />They aided to produce the supine attitude in which the <rs>Government</rs> indulged last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322" />Their results were: <placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName>, <placeName reg="Roanoke, Roanoke, Virginia" key="tgn,7014343" authname="tgn,7014343">Roanoke</placeName>, <placeName reg="Port Royal, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113716" authname="tgn,2113716">Port Royal</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee" authname="tgn,7017741">Donelson</placeName>, New Orleans, &amp;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323" /> Much, everything, depends upon the prompt action of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324" />We cannot but hope that it will leave at home all the leaven of demagogusism which it contracted under the old Yankee Government, and recognize the change in its circumstances, as well as in the people of the country. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
