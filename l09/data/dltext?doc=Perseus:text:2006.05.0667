<milestone unit="sentence" n="241" />If he has, all is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242" />But if he has merely gotten out of the way, with the design to go to reinforce the army facing <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0" authname="grant"><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName>, which <measure n="300miles" type="distance">three hundred miles</measure> off, then <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825" authname="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName> is in great danger, if <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0" authname="rosecrans"><surname full="yes">Rosecrans</surname></persName> wishes to take it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244" />That is a lie on the face of it. There is no doubt that our men beat the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, as they always do — as they did at <placeName reg="Perryville, Boyle, Kentucky" key="tgn,7017532" authname="tgn,7017532">Perryville</placeName> last summer — and that <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0" authname="bragg"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Bragg</surname></persName> has repeated the game he played then; that is to say, he has become alarmed at his own success and run away from it. <num value="1">One</num> would think <sic>that</sic> memorable example would have been enough. </p> </div3>

<head>The peace rumors.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245" /> Whenever our armies win a battle, we forthwith hear a <num value="1000">thousand</num> rumors of approaching peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246" />Such rumor sure particularly rife just at this moment, when they have just won a couple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247" />We wish we could see any just ground for believing peace near, but we confess we see none whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248" />Our victories around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> were followed, on the part of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00241" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,," authname="lincoln,a."><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>, by a call for <num value="300000">300,000</num> additional men, and this call was succeeded, in a very short time, by another <num value="300000">300,000</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249" />The whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force, on paper, since the beginning of the war is <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> <num value="1000">thousand</num> men. Of these, we are told, about <num value="350000">three hundred and fifty thousand</num> have been slaughtered or put <hi rend="italics">hors de combat,</hi> so that, on paper, there are now about <num value="850000">850,000</num> men. A contemporary disposed of nearly half of these as deserters, or sick, or otherwise absent from their colors; so that only about <num value="450000">450,000</num> are left to do the fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250" />Yet this is a tremendous army, and as, thus far, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> feel perfectly safe at home, they can send it all here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251" />And they will send it all here, and we shall not be able to obtain peace until we shall have slaughtered at least half of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252" /> It should be recollected that none of our victories, though glorious to those who gained them, have been decisive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253" />We have struck many hard blows; but we have not yet annihilated an army, or rendered it so inefficient that it could molest us no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254" />There has been no <placeName reg="Austerlitz, Bourbon, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037561" authname="tgn,2037561">Austerlitz</placeName> no Jenna, no <placeName reg="Waterloo, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2753461" authname="tgn,2753461">Waterloo</placeName>, in any of our campaigns; and though our victories have been of great importance to us, they have failed to dishearten the enemy and to convince him that the undertaking he is engaged in is hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255" />We must do this before we can hope for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256" />There is every reason to believe that it will be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257" />Every battle has been won by us, and we may therefore set it down as established that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are not a match for us in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258" />The day of decisive victory — victory producing great immediate results — victory so unmistakable as to convince the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mind that there is no hope — must come; but it has not come yet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259" /> We shall be compelled to meet the preparations the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are making for the spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260" />Of that we may rest assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261" />They are on a scale of the most stupendous magnitude, but they can be neutralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262" />Let us do this — let us prove that the present armament can do nothing to subjugate us and we feel well assured that they will never raise another of the same size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263" />But we must, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, meet it, and beat it. In order to do so not the slightest realization in recruiting our ranks must be allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264" />The conscription must go on as though we were in the most desperate extremities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265" />We must have an army in the field as nearly as possible approaching that of the enemy in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266" />We are happy to believe that this is being done with great strictness and regularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267" />Let it be done thoroughly and completely, and we shall find it the best and surest means of obtaining peace.
