<milestone unit="sentence" n="68" />He defied them to point out any <num value="1">one</num> sentence in all the various addresses that he had made in that canvass that could be tortured into enmity against the <rs>South</rs>, except, he remarked, <num value="1">one</num> expression, namely, that <q direct="unspecified">"a house divided against itself must fall; they must either be all slave or all free States,"</q> and he said that he explained afterwards that <sic>that</sic> was an abstract opinion, and never intended to be made the basis of his political action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69" />He remarked at the sometime that the clause in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> requiring fugitive slaves to be delivered up was a constitutional provision; was a part of the organic law of the land, and that he would execute it with more fidelity than any Southern man that they could possibly find, and that he could not imagine what was the cause of the deep and apparently settled enmity that existed towards him throughout the entire <rs>South</rs>, looking at me at the time as if to invite an answer from me. I replied that he was very much mistaken if he supposed that the deep pervading feeling throughout the <rs>South</rs> originated in any personal enmity towards himself; that I did not suppose that there was any feeling of that kind on the part of an individual in the <rs>South</rs>; that he was the representative of a great party — of a very sectional party — elected on a platform which they considered would, if carried out, be destructive of their dearest and best rights; and that it was on that account, and that alone — the attempt to throw a common Government, the <rs>Government</rs> for all the <name>States</name>, in antagonism to the interests of a portion of the very State whose Government it was, which was the cause of the deep and settled feeling which existed throughout the entire <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70" />We appealed to him then to give the guarantees which were demanded by the <rs>Southern</rs> men in that <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName>, representing to him that it was in his power; that he was at that time a power in the <rs>State</rs>; that he held in the hollow of his hand the destiny of <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> of people; that if he said that the guarantee should be made, and would make it, there would be no difficulty in carrying out any programme that might be adopted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71" /> He said that he was willing to give a constitutional guarantee that slavery should not be molested in any way, directly or indirectly, in the <name>States</name>; that he was willing to go further, and give a guarantee that it should not be molested in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>; that he would go still further, and say that it should not be disturbed in the decks, arsenals forts, and other places within the slaveholding States; but as for slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, that his whole life was dedicated in opposition to its extension there; that he was elected by a party which had made that a portion of its platform, and he should consider that he was betraying that party if he ever agreed, under any state of the case, to allow slavery to be extended in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72" />We pointed out to him that there was not an acre of territory belonging to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> where the foot of a slave could ever tread; that there were natural laws which would forbid slavery going into a mountainous region, and the solder regions of the <rs>North</rs>; and that it was utterly impossible that slavery could ever extend there; and we denied that a common Government had power to make the prohibition, and asked him why, if he was a really true, sincere, Union man, have an empty prohibition when the laws of nature were a stronger prohibition than any that could be passed by act of Congress?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73" />(Hear, hear.) That he waived, by saying that he was committed on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74" />Then it was that i replied to him: <q direct="unspecified">"<rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, you say you were accidentally selected and elected by a party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75" />You were the candidate of the party, but when you were elected, sir, I thought — I have been taught to believe — that you were the <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>Union</rs>--I opposed you, sir."</q> I said to him: <q direct="unspecified">"With all the zeal and energy of which I was master, I endeavored to prevent your election — not because I had any personal feelings of enmity towards you, but because I believed that it would lead to the very result we now witness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76" />I opposed you, sir; but your are my <rs type="role2">President</rs> — you have been elected according to the forms of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and you are the <rs>President</rs> of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and I think that some little deference is due to the opinions of those who constitute the majority, according to the vote that has been polled, of <num value="1100000">1,100,000</num> men in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>."</q> </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78" /> I responded at once to him that I did not intend to recall to him that he was a minority <rs type="role2">President</rs>, but simply to announce the broad fact that he was the <rs>President</rs> not of the men who voted for him, but of the whole people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and that of the wishes and feelings and interests of the whole people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--the party with <num value="1100000">1,100,000</num> majority as well as the minority party by whom he was elected, ought to be consulted by him. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80" />He illustrated very distinctly and clearly those <num value="3">three</num> propositions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81" /> When the conversation had slackened a little I ventured to appeal to him in a manner in which I never appealed to any other man, and never expect to do again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82" />I said that as to the last proposition I desired to say <num value="1">one</num> word — that I trusted and prayed to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that he would not resort to coercion; that if he did, the history of his Administration would be written in blood, and all the waters of the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206" authname="tgn,7014206">Atlantic ocean</placeName> could never wash it from his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83" />(Hear, hear, and applause.) He asked me what I would do, and if meant by coercion the collection of the revenue and the taking back of the forts which he said belonged to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84" />I replied that <sic>that</sic> was the only mode in which was it possible that he could, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, resort to coercion — by an attempt to collect the revenue and to take back the forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85" />He had placed himself in a chair with rounds to it, with his feet upon the highest round — a long, lanky man, with very large side whiskers, with his elbows upon his knees, and his hands upon the <unclear /> of his face, in an attitude of listening, and when he would speak he would drop his hands and raise his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86" />Dropping his hand and raising his head, he said he would tell me a little anecdote which had happened when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came to the bar. An old man, he said, had applied to him to bring a suit, and made out a capital case, as he thought; but when the evidence was detailed before the jury it was the worst case he had ever listened to, and while the evidence was going on the old man came, listening to the evidence himself, and whispered in his ear, <q direct="unspecified">"Guv it up."</q>--(Laughter) <q direct="unspecified">"Now,"</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">"Governor, wouldn't this be 'guvin' it up!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91" />Is it not an impossibility, and does your oath bind you to do a thing that is impossible?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92" />As to the forts, that is a matter within your discretion, sir.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93" /> <q direct="unspecified">"Well,"</q> said he, raising himself again, <q direct="unspecified">"I will only answer you by telling you a little anecdote which struck me — excuse me,"</q> says he, <q direct="unspecified">"a little anecdote which struck me as you were going on.--It is from Esop's fables, and doubtless in your schoolboy days you have read it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94" />They were afraid of the power of the lion, with his long and sharp claws and his tusks, and they said to him: <cit><q rend="inline" direct="unspecified">'We can have no objection to so respectable a personage as you but our daughter is frail and delicate, and we hope that you will submit to have your claws out off and your tusks drawn, because they might do very serious injury to her'</q><bibl default="NO" /></cit> The lion submitted being very much in love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95" />His claws were cut off and his tusks drawn, and they took clubs and then knocked him on the head."</q> (Laughter.) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96" /> I replied, I think, about in substance this — that it was an exceedingly interesting anecdote, and <milestone unit="column" n="3" /> very <hi rend="italics">apprepes,</hi> but not altogether a satisfactory answer to me, and then said to him, <q direct="unspecified">"<persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>, this to me, sir, is the most serious and all absorbing subject that has ever engaged my attention as a public man.
