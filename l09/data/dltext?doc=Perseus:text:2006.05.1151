<milestone unit="sentence" n="343" /> We regard the cry which some of the press of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is raising for peace as fraught with raischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344" />Nothing could have a more direct tendency to encourage our enemy to persevere in the iniquitous war he is waging against us without, as far as we can perceive, the slightest disposition to relax or to compromise, even if compromise were possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345" />But it is not possible, so far as we can see, and so far as boundaries are concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346" />The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has no right to give up <num value="1">one</num> foot of territory belonging to, or claimed by, any <num value="1">one</num> of the sovereignties whose agent it is.--The Yankee Government will not agree, at this time, to make peace without a huge slice from these territories; perhaps, in some instances, without the surrender of whole States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347" />In <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, it would insist upon claiming what they call New Virginia, in addition to <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597" authname="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> and <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231" authname="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349" />Elsewhere their claims would be based strictly upon the principle of <hi rend="italics"><unclear /></hi> Now, the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> cannot make any such treaty as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350" />It cannot cede any territory belonging to any of these States, each <num value="1">one</num> of which is a nation — a sovereignty as distinct as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351" />It can make peace on no other terms, so far as we can see, than those upon which it has more than once pledged itself — absolute independence and the complete integrity of all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352" />When, therefore, we hear people talking about the astuteness of the <rs>Yankees</rs>, and the danger there is of their overreaching us, &amp;c., we do not understand what they mean. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353" /> Our people are tired of the war, no doubt, and this is the reason why they are so easily deceived by every thing relating to peace that comes from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354" />They ought to understand, if they do not, that there are <num value="2">two</num> parties there, <num value="1">one</num> of which is in and the other out; and that the party which is out is trying to get in. The party which is in is the party which is prosecuting this war. The party which is out, constitutes <num value="2">two</num> parties of the most opposite sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355" /><num value="1">One</num> of them is more hostile to us than <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00257" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>'s party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357" />If they combine at all, which is extremely doubtful, it will be for the purpose of expelling the present incumbent, (a very difficult job,) and getting possession-of the spoils, which are, beyond computation, enormous, and for no purpose of patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358" />Should they even succeed, which we hold to be nigh akin to a miracle, it is very doubtful whether we should have peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359" />The present war causes a disbursement of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360" />We doubt very much whether there is any party in Yankeedom possessing virtue enough to resist the temptation of handling such a sum; and the successful party must forego all hope of doing so if it put an end to the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361" /> The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, the other day, advised <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00259" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> to send commissioners to treat of peace without raising the blockade or withdrawing the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362" />Of course it knew, and acknowledged that it knew, that such a proposition would not be listened to. But it, of its own accord, explained what it proposed to effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363" />It was nothing more nor less than a trick "to take the wind out of the sails of the <name>Peace</name> party." Every proposition from this quarter partakes more or less of the same character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364" />Even if we expected anything from the <name>Peace</name> party, which we do not, we should think it not at all advisable to mix up our cause with their proceedings.
