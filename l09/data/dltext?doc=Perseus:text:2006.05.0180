<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />On a nearer approach the fortress was discovered to be occupied, the guns appeared to be mounted, and sentinels were discovered on duty, and the place to give every sign of occupancy and military discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />The grim fortress frowned defiance on every side — the busy notes of preparation resounded through its unforbidden recesses, and everything seemed to indicate the utmost alacrity in the work on hand. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" /> Turning towards <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina" authname="tgn,2335409">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, a dense cloud of smoke was seen to pour from the end facing the sea. The flagstaff was down, and the whole place had an air of desolation and abandonment quite the reverse of its busy look <num value="1">one</num> week ago, when scores of laborers were engaged in adding to its strength all that work, skill and experience could suggest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" /> In the immediate vicinity of the rear or land side entrance, however, greater activity was noticeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />At the time of our visit, a large force of hands had been summoned to deliver up their implements for transportation to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina" authname="tgn,7013582">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" />Around on every side were the evidences of labor in the fortification of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />In many places, a portion of the defences were strengthened by every appliance that art could suggest or ingenuity devise; while, in others, the uncompleted works gave evidences of the utmost confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />On all hands the process of removing goods, furniture and munitions, was yet going on. The heavy guns upon the ramparts of the <rs>Fort</rs> were thrown down from their carriages and spiked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />Every ounce of powder, and every cartridge had been removed from the magazines; and, in fact, everything like small arms, clothing, provisions, accoutrements, and other munitions of war, had been removed off and deposited — nothing but heavy balls and useless cannon remained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" /> The entire place was, to all appearances, littered up with the odd ends and fragments of war's desolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />Confusion could not have been more complete had the late occupants retired in the face of a besieging foe. Fragments of gun carriages, &amp;c., broken to pieces, bestrewed the ramparts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />Sand bags, and barrels filled with earth, crowned the walls and were firmly imbedded in their bomb-proof surface, as an additional safeguard — and notwithstanding the heterogeneous scattering of materials and implements, the walls of the fort evinced a vague degree of energy in preparing for an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />A ditch some <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> wide and about the same in depth surrounds the entire wall on <num value="3">three</num> sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />On the south side or front, a glacis has been commenced and prosecuted nearly to completion, with a rampart of sand bags; barrels &amp;c. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />New embrasures have been cut in the walls, so as to command the faces of the bastions and ditch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" />These new defences are all incomplete, and are evidence of the haste with which they were erected.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50" /> A greater portion of the labor expended was spent upon the citadel or centre of the west point of the position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51" />This he had caused to be strengthened in every way — loop-holes were cut and everything was so arranged, that in case a well-concerted attack was made, he would have retired from the outer bastions to the citadel, and afterwards blown up the other portions of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52" />For this purpose, mines had already been sprung, and trains had been laid ready for the application of the match.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53" />The barrack rooms and every other part of the fort that was indefensible, would have gone at a touch. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55" />As soon as the evacuation of the fort was complete, the carriages of these guns were fired, and at the time of visiting the fort yesterday, were nearly consumed, and the guns thereby dismounted.--These guns, as well as those constituting the entire armament of the fortress, were spiked before it was abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56" />This is the only damage done the fortification, further than cutting down the flag staff, and the breaking <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> up of ammunition wagons to form ramparts on the walls of the fort. </p> </div4>
