<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />The same state of quiet reported for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> past continues on the lines in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404" authname="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />We have the assurance of persons who came over by last evening's train that only <num value="3">three</num> shells were thrown at the city during <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" />This, with some picket firing, constitutes the total of recent active hostilities in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />It seems now to be well ascertained that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,," authname="grant,gen"><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName> is busily mining on our left, and has been engaged in this underground work for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />What he expects to accomplish by operations of this sort is more than we can explain, though as he is a great believer in the spade as an instrument of warfare, it is quite possible that he designs the reduction of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404" authname="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and the destruction of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,," authname="lee,r.,e."><surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> by that method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />His disappointment will be signal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />It is also ascertained that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,," authname="grant,gen"><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName> is strengthening his extreme left, resting upon the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />This is his weak point, he having been twice flanked in that direction, with considerable loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />It is stated by deserters that the <rs>Yankees</rs> have been on the lookout for <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> nights past, expecting an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />What gave rise to this idea does not seem to be known; but it is quite certain that nothing of the sort occurred, with the exception of the heavy cannonade on <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. The report that the enemy had crossed a heavy force to the north side of the <rs>James</rs> has dwindled, down to a statement that he sent over a portion of <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName> on <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Friday</day></dateStruct>, near <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477" authname="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, which is doubtless correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />This agrees with intelligence we had previously learned and published in this paper.--The object of this movement is probably to prevent our artillery firing upon the <name n="United States">Yankee</name> transports. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />Our informant states that not more than <num value="14">fourteen</num> rounds were fired, and so slight was the engagement that companies stationed <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> off knew nothing of it until the prisoners were brought in.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" /> On Saturday the enemy took possession of some pits which had been used by our artillery firing upon the <name n="United States">Yankee</name> transports, and proceeded to construct fortifications in the vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118" />This assertion, to which we then gave, and still do, entire credence, was accepted by us as the evidence of an unexpected but most gratifying change in the policy of the <rs>President</rs> — a change which we felt authorized to hope might terminate in the conclusion of a peace mutually just, honorable and advantageous to the <rs>North</rs> and to the <rs>South</rs>, exacting no condition but that we should be "duly accredited from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> as bearers of propositions looking to the establishment of peace." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119" /> Thus proffering a basts for conference as comprehensive as we could desire it, it seemed to us that the <rs>President</rs> opened a door which had previously been closed against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> for a full interchange of sentiments, free discussion of conflicting opinions, and untrammeled effort to remove all causes of controversy by liberal negotiations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120" />We, indeed, could not claim the benefit of a safe conduct which had been extended to us in a character we had no right to assume and had never affected to possess; but the uniform declarations of our Executive and Congress, and their thrice repeated, and as often repulsed, attempts to open negotiations, furnish a sufficient pledge that this conciliatory manifestation on the part of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would be <unclear /> by them in a temper of equal <unclear /> We had, therefore, no hesitation in declaring that, if this </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4" />

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122" /> We feel confident that you must share our profound regret that the spirit which declared the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step towards peace had not continued to animals the counsels of your <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123" />Had the representatives of the <num value="2">two</num> Governments met to <sic>cosider</sic> this question — the most momentous ever submitted to human statesmanship — in a temper of becoming moderation and equity, followed as their deliberations would have been by the prayers and benedictions of every patriot and <name>Christian</name> on the habitable globe, who is there so bold as to say that the rightful waste of individual happiness and public prosperity which is daily saddening the universal heart might not have been terminated, or if the desolation and carnage of war must still be endured through weary years of blood and suffering, that there might not at least have been infused into its conduct something more of the spirit which softens and partially redeems its brutalities? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124" /> Instead of the safe conduct which we solicited, and which your <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> letter gave us every reason to suppose would be extended for the purpose of initiating a negotiation in which neither Government would compromise its rights or its dignity, a document has been presented which provokes as much indignation as surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125" />It bears no feature of resemblance to that which was originally offered, and is unlike any paper which ever before emanated from the constitutional Executive of a free people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126" />Addressed "To Whom it May Concern," It precludes negotiation and prescribes in advance the terms and conditions of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127" />It returns to the original policy of "no bargaining, no negotiations, no truces with rebels, except to bury their dead, until every man shall have laid-down his arms, submitted to the <rs>Government</rs>, and sued for mercy." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128" /> What may be the explanation of this sudden and entire change in the views of the <rs>President</rs>, of this rude withdrawal of a courteous overture for negotiation at the moment it was likely to be accepted, of this emphatic recall of words of price just uttered, and fresh blasts of war to the bitter end, we leave for the speculation of those who have the means or inclination to penetrate the mysteries of his Cabinet or fathom the caprice of his imperial will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129" />It is enough for us to say that we have no use whatever for the paper which has been placed in our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132" />If it can be secured only by their submission to terms of conquest, the generation is yet unborn which will witness its restitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133" />If there be any military autocrat in the <rs>North</rs> who is entitled to proffer the conditions of this manifesto, there is none in the <rs>South</rs> authorized to entertain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134" />Those who control our armies are the servants of the people, not their masters; and they have no more intimation than they have right to subvert the social institutions of the sovereign States, to overthrow their established constitutions, and to barter away their priceless heritage of self government. </p>
