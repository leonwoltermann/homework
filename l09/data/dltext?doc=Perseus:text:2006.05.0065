<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />The Conference was composed of representatives from <num value="7">seven</num> slaveholding States and <num value="14">fourteen</num> non-slaveholding States; and while to some extent there was a disposition adverse to the views of the <rs>Southern</rs> members, he was gratified to find a more general disposition to restore harmony and to perpetuate the <rs>Union</rs>, especially on the part of the <rs>Commissioners</rs> from the border non-slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />Beyond that border line, <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711" authname="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> through all proceeded in entire harmony with the wishes of those from the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />There was a hopeful interest throughout for strengthening the bonds of Union, exhibited in the outstretching efforts on the part of those States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />He also included <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251" authname="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> and <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252" authname="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, the latter, however, did not vote on the final adoption of the propositions, declining to do so under instructions of her Legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" />After more further introductory remarks, he proceeded to consider the propositions, and gave his views at length upon each separate recommendation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48" />In regard to the dividing line of <num value="36">36</num> deg. <num value="30">30</num> min., if that was an objection to these propositions, the same could be urged against <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="nearbymention:Crittenden,John,J.,," authname="crittenden,john,j."><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Crittenden</surname></persName>'s, which the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> had endorsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49" />They declared that the status of persons held to service and labor shall not be changed; or that the condition of slaves shall not be changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50" />Slavery is already established on the <rs>South</rs> side of this line, and has received full and ample protection from the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565" authname="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51" />He read from the <name>Code</name> adopted by the <name>Legislature</name> of that Territory, entitled <q direct="unspecified">"an act to provide for the protection of property in slaves in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>."</q> It was, he said, a full, complete and perfect codification of all acts necessary for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52" />The <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> report makes a declaration of the existence of slavery in the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>, and recognizes the right to emigrate there with such property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53" />Many persons, he thought, had misconstrued the proposition as regards the protection proposed to be furnished by law, and argued that nothing furnished so complete protection as the common law. That was resorted to in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54" />There was no deficiency in the supply of remedies, if any were required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55" />As to the objection that the words <q direct="unspecified">"slave"</q> and <q direct="unspecified">"<placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa," authname="tgn,7001242">African</placeName> slavery"</q> do not appear in the propositions, he referred to the history of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, where the terms are not used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56" />In adopting that instrument, the question occurred as to how far slaves should count in the matter of representation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57" />Southern politicians held that they should not be counted at all while the <rs>North</rs> thought they should be counted entire; and they compromised by taking <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58" />In the fugitive slave clause, the term <q direct="unspecified"> "persons held to service"</q> was supplied by a Representative from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712" authname="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59" />They saw no necessity for changing the phrase in amending the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and he did not therefore think the propositions were obnoxious in that point of view. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60" /> He went on to show that the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> propositions afforded equal protection with the <name>Crittenden</name> proposition, and in regard to the dividing line, he thought they acquired what was better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61" />He had moved the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Section">Second section</orgName> as a substitute for the section reported by the <rs>Committee</rs> in the <name>Conference</name>, for the purpose of giving the <rs>South</rs> an equal chance in the future acquisition of territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62" />[This point was elaborately argued by <persName n="Summers,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:Summers,nomatch:0" authname="summers"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Summers</surname></persName>, but we do not desire to impair the effect of his positions by giving a partial report.] All voted for the <name>Crittenden</name> proposition in the <name>Conference</name>, under the instructions of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>, but could not obtain it. He then proposed to substitute for it equality of rights and of acquisition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63" />If the <name>States</name> were all again in combination — and none were more hopeful than himself that they would be — they would have sufficient power to maintain it. In the present condition of things, with only <num value="8">eight</num> slave States, it would be impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64" />He called the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> Report <q direct="unspecified">"the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> example of the self-protecting power of sections."</q> The <rs>North</rs> were looking to future acquisitions as much as we were — perhaps more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65" />It was said in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, by a very adroit and distinguished Northern politician, that they had an eye upon <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685" authname="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, and it would come.--They were also looking to the <rs type="place">Sandwich Islands</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66" />The Conference proposition puts a stop to such proceedings, unless by a majority of both sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67" />It enables you to settle all these matters in advance; it enables you to bargain; and unless it is settled fairly, it cannot be done at all. You can contest future acquisitions with them, foot by foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68" />With <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> regard to <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380" authname="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, he said there was no trouble to be apprehended on that score; the <rs>North</rs> was more anxious to obtain it than the <rs>South</rs> was; and if <persName n="Cuba,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Cuba,nomatch:0" authname="cuba"><surname full="yes">Cuba</surname></persName> comes in, she must come as a great slave State, for without the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> her vast wealth cannot be developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69" />He looked upon the <name>Peace</name> proposition as making a better disposition of the <name>Territorial</name> questions than the <name>Crittenden</name> proposition; equal in rights and privileges, and infinitely better in regard to that which may be before us in the future. </p>

We did not mean to deny his claims to rank with them, and yet the omission was not made through inadvertence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336" />We were thinking of the <rs>Divine Comedy</rs>, all the time, while we were writing the paragraph about the singular coincidence of fate between the <rs>Grecian</rs> and the <rs>English</rs> poet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337" />But we were calling attention to the loss of all knowledge with regard to the personal history of these <num value="2">two</num> great men. <num value="1">One</num> of them lived several centuries before the invention of writing, so far as it is possible to ascertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338" />There were, of course, no written contemporary memorials of him. His personal history was the subject of tradition alone, and became, in the lapse of time, so intermingled with fables, that it is impossible to fix upon any <num value="1">one</num> circumstance related with regard to him, as an undoubted truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339" />The other lived, it is true, in a highly enlightened age. He did not, as somebody has said, stand up grand and solitary, like <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Teneriffe, Henderson, North Carolina" key="tgn,2714714" authname="tgn,2714714">Teneriffe</placeName>,</hi> in the midst of the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341" />He was surrounded by great men, and he was a head and shoulders taller than them all. It cannot but strike everybody as extremely singular, that we should know no more of him, individually, than we do know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342" />In fact, so far as the undoubted knowledge which we have of his acts and sayings may serve to give us an idea of his character, he is as unknown to us as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00321" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0" authname="homer"><surname full="yes">Homer</surname></persName></hi> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343" />The names of the <num value="2">two</num> men are mere symbols — symbols of the poetic gift in its highest state of perfection — as entirely symbolical as the name of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Apollo,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00322" reg="mostcommon:Apollo,nomatch:0" authname="apollo"><surname full="yes">Apollo</surname></persName>,</hi> or that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Esculapius.</hi> We thought it singular that such should be the lot common to <num value="2">two</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> men whom the world has agreed to call the greatest of poets, and we doubted whether their individual obscurity might not be the penalty of their pre-eminence in song. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344" /> If we doubted before, however, our doubts were removed by thinking upon their compeer, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00323" reg="mostcommon:Dante,nomatch:0" authname="dante"><surname full="yes">Dante</surname></persName>.</hi> Unlike his mighty brethren, he has left abundant traces of his personal history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345" />No man of his day was better known in his day, and no man of his day is better known to posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348" />He was exiled for his adherence to an unfortunate faction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349" />Of course his life was public, and could not fail to be recorded, when his poem had given his name such a wonderful power of attraction.
