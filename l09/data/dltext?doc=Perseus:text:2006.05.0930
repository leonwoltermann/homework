<milestone unit="sentence" n="346" />On the contrary, they are never so happy as when they are miserable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347" />Their solemn, guttural utterances only arise from the peculiar conformations of their organism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352" />They are not content with being out of the army, with being protected in their persons and estates from even the <num value="8">eight</num> of an armed foe, but they must keep up a brisk fire in the rear of their civil and military protectors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353" />Not being engaged in fighting the <rs>Yankees</rs>, they give exercise to the valor which might otherwise rust in inaction, by furious assaults upon Confederate <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356" />If they are as great in action as in speech, and will go to the front, they will bring the war to a close in <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. It is very easy to find fault, and to saddle every misfortune upon the misconduct of our leaders, but the public at large ought to bear in mind that, unless they know all the facts, and are well instructed in military matters, they ought to withhold their verdict upon the public men charged with the responsibility of a military misfortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357" />The Government, which knows all the facts, must be presumed to have grounds for its action or non-action which, for reasons of public interest, cannot always be made known to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362" />If he was afterwards defeated, who can tell us what his means of resistance were, how many men he had, and whether he was expected, with possibly <num value="1">one</num> man to <num value="4">four</num>, to accomplish impossibilities.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365" /> The truth is, we have been struggling from the beginning of this war against such enormous odds that the wonder to our mind is, not that we have occasional disasters, but that disaster has not been the rule, and success the exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368" />As for men, our sparse population did not seem to afford a mouthful for the hungry giant of the <rs>North</rs>, backed by the inexhaustible swarms of the Old World.
