<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" /> The British Emancipation Act, passed in <dateStruct value="1834--" full="yes" authname="1834"><year reg="1834" full="yes">1834</year></dateStruct>, provided for the liberation of about <num value="800000">eight hundred thousand</num> slaves in <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> from the passage of the act. The sum appropriated for the compensation of the proprietors was <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> of pounds sterling, or not half the value of the slave, and in many instances not <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />From the date of that act the agricultural produce of the island gradually disappeared, until it became a wilderness in comparison with its former fertility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />The planters never received anything but the interest of the <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num>; and their once garden like estates have returned, like the negroes, to the freedom of nature. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" /> The island of <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388" authname="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>, before the emancipation of the negroes, produced <measure n="700000000l." type="pounds"><num value="700000000">seven hundred millions</num> pounds</measure> of sugar, being more than all the rest of the world put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />After emancipation, it was compelled to <hi rend="italics">import</hi> that article.--Let us hear <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0" authname="napoleon"><surname full="yes">Napoleon</surname></persName>: "Had any of your philosophic Liberals come out to <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833" authname="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> to proclaim liberty to the blacks or the <name>Arabs</name>, I would have hung him up to the mast-head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />In the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550" authname="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>, similar enthusiasts have delivered over the whites to the ferocity of the blacks; and yet they complain of the victims of such madness being discontented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />How is it possible to give liberty to Africans when they are destitute of any species of civilization, and ignorant even of what a colony or mother country is?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />Do you suppose that, had they been aware of what they were doing, they would have given liberty to the blacks?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />Certainly not; but few persons at that time were sufficiently far-sighted to foresee the results; and feelings of humanity are ever powerful with excited imaginations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />But now, after the experience we have had, to maintain the same principles cannot be done in good faith; it can be the result only of overweening self-confidence or hypocrisy." Yet the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with all this experience before its eyes, is frantic for the immediate abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />It will not even accord the <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> of apprenticeship permitted by the <rs>British Emancipation Act</rs>, although it required <measure n="500years" type="date">five hundred years</measure> to wear out <hi rend="italics">white</hi> slavery in the <placeName reg="British Isles" key="tgn,1009896" authname="tgn,1009896">British islands</placeName> and render the transition from servitude to liberty safe and salutary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />The <rs>African</rs> can be clothed with the habits and desires of a freeman by a simple act of immediate and unconditional liberation! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" /> In the palmy days of her <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa," authname="tgn,7001242">African</placeName> slave trade, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> transferred above <num value="700000">seven hundred thousand</num> negroes to this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, which is believed to be the most extraordinary example in the history of mankind of so considerable a removal from <num value="1">one</num> part of the world <milestone unit="column" n="3" /> to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />In <dateStruct value="1807--" full="yes" authname="1807"><year reg="1807" full="yes">1807</year></dateStruct>, having turned philanthropist, she put a peremptory stop to the slave trade; notwithstanding which, the slave trade became doubled in extent and quadrupled in horrors!--Whilst the agricultural produce of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550" authname="tgn,7004550">British West Indies</placeName> rapidly declined, those colonies of other nations which still retained slave labor received an impetus of prosperity which is almost incredible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" /><placeName reg="Puerto Rico" key="tgn,7004643" authname="tgn,7004643">Puerto Rico</placeName>, which <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> before only exported cattle and coffee and imported sugar, exported, in a short period after the passage of the <rs>British Emancipation Act</rs>, more than a <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> of the whole <name>British</name> consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />The increase of the sugar exportation from <placeName reg="Cuba" key="tgn,7005380" authname="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName> and <placeName reg="Brasil" key="tgn,1000047" authname="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName> was equally marked and wonderful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />This prodigious increase was the result of the emancipation madness of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, and was, of course, only obtained by a vast increase in the importation of the <name>African</name> race. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" /> The whole history of mankind proves that slavery is a necessary step in the progress of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />Without it, savage man never has worked, and never can be induced to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />For that reason it could not be expected from <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas" authname="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> or <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102" authname="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, nor among our <persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0" authname="saxon"><surname full="yes">Saxon</surname></persName> progenitors for <measure n="500years" type="date">five hundred years</measure>; for that reason it still exists over the larger portion of the <rs>Globe</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />Whatever evils may be attendant on servitude, they are unimportant in comparison with the total stoppage of the advance and prospects of the human race which would follow universal abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />If the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could succeed in the overthrow of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa," authname="tgn,7001242">African</placeName> slavery within our limits, we should have the stern consolation of knowing that it had totally and forever involved its own prosperity and power in the common ruin. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" /> Scarcely a mail arrives from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> that does not bring a statement from <persName><roleName n="Lord" full="yes">Lord</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Palmerston</foreName></persName> or <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0" authname="russell"><surname full="yes">Russell</surname></persName>, or both, that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> intends to preserve the most rigid neutrality between the <rs>American</rs> belligerents, and that, in their opinion, the time for intervention has not yet arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />The war has lasted now nearly <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and the same stereotyped missive is constantly crossing the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, until it seems to have become a regular part of the invoice of every steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />If it should last <measure n="400years" type="date">four hundred years</measure>, and the <num value="2">two</num> old earls, who seem to have as many lives as a cat, could live so long, we should have the same message to the end of the chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />The time for intervention will only arrive when <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611" authname="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> is destroyed, the <name>Revolution</name> of '<num value="76">76</num> avenged, and the only commercial rival of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> swept from the face of the earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" /> These <num value="2">two</num> old gentlemen seem to be putting themselves to a great deal of unnecessary trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />At their time of life, they would better employ themselves in settling their own individual affairs for a future state of existence, and give sublunary, and especially trans-Atlantic things, the go-by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />We are not so hopelessly thick-headed as not to comprehend the same statement when it is made a <num value="100">hundred</num> times over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />They need not be hurrying their gouty old legs to every steamer and sending over their compliments--"rigid neutrality, etc., but not yet time to intervene." They are both very interesting persons; and that intelligence, when they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> communicated it, was a very interesting piece of news; but we venture to suggest that the best thing in the world loses by infinite repetition.--Their explication of the position of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is well understood both here and in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as they themselves also are. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" /> If they expect to keep the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in good humor by the eternally reiterated declaration of their neutrality, they have adopted a singular mode of effecting their object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />It is precisely the recognition of the <rs>South</rs> as a belligerent which has offended the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> past all atonement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> look upon the <rs>South</rs> as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> does upon <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire" authname="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName> — part and parcel of the empire — and here is <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, exalting her rebellious province to the dignity of a belligerent, and constantly declaring that she will not take sides with either.--It was lately urged in the <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">United States Senate</orgName>, that, but for the recognition of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as a belligerent power, <persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0" authname="semmes"><surname full="yes">Semmes</surname></persName> and our other cruisers would have been treated by the whole world as pirates, and, consequently, the commerce of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have been safe from harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />The speaker <milestone unit="column" n="4" /> therefore proposed that a demand should be made upon <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> for all the losses which <name>Yankee</name> commerce has sustained by Confederate cruisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />The fact that these cruisers are principally British-built and British-manned has led to a prevalent idea in the <rs>North</rs> that they are neither more nor less than <name>British</name> privateers, fitted out with the knowledge of the <rs>British Government</rs> to prey upon <name>Yankee</name> commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />This is a very uncharitable notion, we admit; but it none the less exists, and, should the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> fail, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> will be called upon to make good all damages to <name>Yankee</name> merchantmen in this war, and, what is more, she will have to foot the bill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" /> For, in the event of its success, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will be no longer the same nation that it was when, in the palmy days of that political eunuch, <persName n="Buchanan,,James,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Buchanan,James,,," authname="buchanan,james"><foreName full="yes">James</foreName> <surname full="yes">Buchanan</surname></persName>, <name>English</name> gunboats chased and boarded our own vessels on our own coast, and when <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Bull,John,,," authname="bull,john"><foreName full="yes">John</foreName> <surname full="yes">Bull</surname></persName> twisted the nose and slapped the jaws of <persName><roleName n="Brother" full="yes">brother</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Jonathan</foreName></persName> as suited his sovereign convenience.
