<head>Interior lines.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272" /> The importance of interior lines to forces superior on the whole in point of numbers has been frequently demonstrated in practice, and never until a few years ago disputed in theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273" />The preservation of these lines has led to some of the most memorable achievements recorded in the history of war. It was by means of an interior line that the <rs>Consul Nero</rs> was enabled to cut off Assumable upon the <name>Metaurus</name> with the forces he was leading to the succor of his <persName><roleName n="Brother" full="yes">brother</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Hannibal</foreName></persName>, and thus render all the victories of that great commander a nullity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274" />It was by means of interior lines that the great <rs>Frederic</rs> was enabled to resist the combined power of <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062" authname="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435" authname="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, defeating their armies <num value="1">one</num> after the other, and never allowing them to unite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275" />These <num value="3">three</num> powers invaded his dominions from <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of the compass — the <name>Bast</name>, the <rs>North</rs>, and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276" />With a vastly inferior force on the whole, being placed in the centre, his marches were shorter, and he could prevent their uniting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277" />He attacked each of them in detail, and was thus enabled on every field to present a force not greatly inferior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278" />Had he waited for them to unite they would easily have overwhelmed him. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280" />He was engaged in the siege of Manitus, which was held by <num value="15000">15,000</num> men. He had but <num value="30000">30,000</num>, all told, to maintain the siege, and drive off the forces that might attempt to relieve it. He placed a certain number of men around the city to keep up the siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281" />He distributed the others at convenient points, so that they could keep the enemy in check long enough for him to reinforce them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282" />He placed <num value="1">one</num> body behind the <name>Adige</name> at Segnano, where the strait road crossed to Manitus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286" />As soon as the enemy approached any of these outposts be was apprised of it, and having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discovered which was the real point of attack and which the false, he concentrated his whole force and attacked the enemy, who was obliged, from the nature of the country, to divide his own. In this way he repelled <num value="4">four</num> separate attacks made in <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure>, and utterly destroyed the armies that made them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287" />In <dateStruct value="1814--" full="yes" authname="1814"><year reg="1814" full="yes">1814</year></dateStruct>, in Champaigne, he repeated this series of manœuvres, and by means of an interior line was enabled with <num value="70000">70,000</num> men to keep at bay, and often defeat, armies numbering <num value="400000">400,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289" />It must be recollected that he depended on <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00255" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0" authname="marmont"><surname full="yes">Marmont</surname></persName> to defend Parish, while he attacked the <name>Allies</name> in the rear, and <sic>that that</sic> traitor gave up the city as soon as the enemy made his appearance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290" /> The <rs>Duke</rs> of <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00256" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0" authname="wellington"><surname full="yes">Wellington</surname></persName>'s defence of <placeName key="tgn,1000090" n="1.000 98" reg="portugal" authname="tgn,1000090">Portugal</placeName> depended on the same principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291" />His lines of operation were interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292" />His army was distributed in such a manner that it could all be rallied on any <num value="1">one</num> point in <measure n="60hours" type="date">sixty hours</measure>. The <rs>French</rs>, on the contrary, were distributed over a country <measure n="400miles" type="distance">four hundred miles</measure> square, and their line of operation was exterior, and therefore presented insuperable difficulties, when combined operations were desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293" />For that reason, although they were greatly superior to <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00257" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0" authname="wellington"><surname full="yes">Wellington</surname></persName> in numbers, they never could rally a force greater than his upon <num value="1">one</num> field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294" />The advantage of numbers was neutralized by the disadvantages of position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295" /> The Polish General, Skrznecki, gained all his victories in the <rs>Polish Revolution</rs> of <dateStruct value="1821--" full="yes" authname="1821"><year reg="1821" full="yes">1821</year></dateStruct> by means of interior lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296" />It is highly probable that, had he pushed his advantages as he should have done, he would have annihilated the whole <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska" authname="tgn,2634462">Russian</placeName> army, but in an evil hour he hesitated, and was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297" />His excuse was, that the attempt was hazardous, and that <persName n="Poland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00258" reg="mostcommon:Poland,nomatch:0" authname="poland"><surname full="yes">Poland</surname></persName> had only that army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298" />He should have reflected that every day's delay strengthened the <name>Russians</name>, and that by hesitating he was rendering his own destruction certain, whereas before it was only probable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299" /> The interior line, it thus appears, is the best way to combat superior numbers, advancing from different points, by enabling the whole force of the weaker party, or at least the larger portion of it, to concentrate against the forces of the enemy while still divided, and preventing their ever coming together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300" />But <num value="1">one</num> thing is absolutely necessary, and that is constant activity, guided by unceasing vigilance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301" />It will not do to slumber a moment in such a position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302" />When the army has been concentrated upon a point, it must attack it, otherwise it leaves its rear exposed to the enterprises of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303" />An interior line is obviously of no value, unless the forces which by its means attack <num value="1">one</num> point can be brought back rapidly to attack another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304" />If the enemy be allowed to get possession of it, he can follow the army that has left it, and thus place it between <num value="2">two</num> fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305" />The army that would strike right and left, must be incessantly on the alert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306" />Its blows must be sudden and powerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307" />It must never go so far that it cannot draw back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308" /> We were in hopes, when our troops fell back, that they intended to concentrate at the termini of the railroads and water carriage, with the intention of changing the system of ditching, which it seems to us has thus far been productive of great disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309" />It may be that such is the intention now. But we greatly fear the spade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310" />It seems to have unaccountable attractions for our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313" />The dangers of division and subdivision, which many apprehend from the disruption of the old Government, can in no way be averted so effectually as by the clear and explicit understanding that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is an assemblage of independent nations, each of which has a perfect right to secede whenever it suits its sovereign will and pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314" />If the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is worth staying in, none of its members will desire to leave it when the only bonds which hold them are those of mutual good fellowship and good will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315" />The very worst argument that can be addressed to a proud and high- spirited people is that of force and compulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323" /> States, like individuals, may give way to morbid impulses of caprice and discontent, but the best way to deal with such cases, should they arise, is to give them plenty of rope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324" />So far from endeavoring to force them to remain in a Union which had become, or was imagined to be unjust and oppressive, we would facilitate their departure, and, if necessary, give them the means of setting up house for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325" />If they had a trait of the prodigal in their disposition, we would divided with them our whole living, and let them go into a far country and make the experiment of trying their own fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342" />With all the channels of communication with the outer world blocked up, and no sources of intelligence to foreign Governments but those which are inimical to us in the highest degree, we should not expect foreign nations to act without great circumspection and such a survey of the whole ground as will save them from the peril of compromising those interests of their peoples which they are bound to promote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504" />This mode of unloading developed the fact, that between the plunger, containing the cap and the plate on which it strikes, cotton had been introduced, thus preventing concussion and consequent explosion when the shell struck the ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505" /> On the side of the plunger a place had been filed in and filled with matches communication with the powder, so that by unscrewing the former the matches would be ignited by the friction, causing the shell to explode.--Who will not say that this was an infernal machine of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> water, and that the following of the enemy in their diabolical purpose was most fortunate?
