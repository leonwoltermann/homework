<p> <unclear /> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> 
<p> Doubtless the proceeding has been the result of inadvertence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" />We feel ourselves at liberty to think that it would not have occurred if we had been so fortunate as to have been heard through you in the consolations of the <rs>French Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />We think we can easily see how the inadvertence occurred.--<placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> seems to have mistaken a mere casual and ephemeral insurrection here, such as is incidental into the experience of all nations, because all nations are merely human societies, such as have sometimes happened in the history of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> herself, for a war which has flagrantly separated this nation into <num value="2">two</num> coexisting political powers which are contending in arms against each other after the separation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" /> It is erroneous, so far as foreign nations are concerned to suppose that any war exists in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" />Certainly there cannot be <num value="2">two</num> belligerent Powers where there is no war. There is here as there has always been, <num value="1">one</num> political Power, namely — the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>--competent to make war and peace, and conduct commerce and alliances with all foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />There is none other, either in fact or recognized by foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15" />There is, indeed, an armed sedition seeking to overthrow the <rs>Government</rs>, and the <rs>Government</rs> is employing military and naval forces to repress it. But these facts do not constitute a war presenting <num value="2">two</num> belligerent Powers, and modifying the national character, rights, and responsibilities, or the characters, rights, and responsibilities of foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />It is true that insurrection may ripen into revolution, and that revolution thus ripened may extinguish a previously existing State, or divide it into <num value="1">one</num> or more independent States, and that if such States continue their strife after such division, then there exists a State of war affecting the characters, rights, and duties of all parties concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />But this only happens when the revolution has run its successful course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" /> The French Government says, in the instruction which has been tendered to us, that certain facts which it assumes confer upon the insurgents of this country, in the eyes of foreign powers, all the appearances of a government <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">de facto, </hi></foreign> wherefore, whatever may be its regrets, the <rs>French Government</rs> must consider the <num value="2">two</num> contending parties as employing the forces at their disposal in conformity with the laws of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" /> This statement assumes not only that the law of nations entitles any insurrectionary taction, when it establishes a <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">de facto</hi></foreign> government, to be treated as a belligerent, but also that the fact of the attainment of this <hi rend="italics">status</hi> is to be determined by the appearance of it in the eyes of foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />If we should concede both of these positions, we should still insist that the existence of a <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">de facto</hi></foreign> government, entitled to belligerent rights, is not established in the present case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />We have already heard from most of the foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />There are only <num value="2">two</num> which seem so to construe appearances, and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />Are the judgments of these <num value="2">two</num> to <sic>outweigh</sic> those of all other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />Doubtless each nation may judge and act for itself, but it certainly cannot expect the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to accept its decision upon a question vital to their national existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" /> The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will not refine upon the question when and how new nations are born out of existing nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />They are well aware that the rights of the <name>States</name> involve their duties and their destinies, and they hold those rights to be absolute as against all foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />These rights do not at all depend on the appearances which their condition may assume in the eyes of foreign nations, whether strangers, neutrals, friends, or even allies.--The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will maintain and defend their sovereignty throughout the bounds of the republic, and they deem all other nations bound to respect that sovereignty until, if ever, <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952" authname="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> shall consent that it shall be successfully overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />Any system of public law or national morality that conflicts with this would resolve society, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in this hemisphere and then in the other, into anarchy and chaos. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" /> This government is sensible of the importance of the step it has taken in declining to bear the communication, the tenor of which has drawn out these explanations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />It believes, however, that it need not disturb the good relations which have so long and so happily subsisted between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" /> The paper, as understood, while implying a disposition on the part of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> to accord belligerent rights to their Sargents, does not name, specify or even indicate <num value="1">one</num> such belligerent right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />On the other hand, the rights which it asserts that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> expects as a neutral, from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as a belligerent, are even less than this Government, on the <date value="04-25" authname="--04-25">25th of April,</date> instructed you to concede and guarantee to her by treaty, as a friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />On that day we offered to her our adhesion to the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0" authname="paris"><surname full="yes">Paris</surname></persName>, which contains <num value="4">four</num> propositions — namely: <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />That privateering shall be abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" /><num value="2">2</num>. That a neutral flag covers enemy's goods not contraband of war. <num value="3">3</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" />That goods of a neutral, not contraband, shall not be confiscated, though found in an enemy's vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" /><num value="4">4</num>. That blockades, in order to be lawful, must be maintained by competent force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />We have always, when at war, conceded the <num value="3">three</num> last of these rights to neutrals <foreign lang="ita"><hi rend="italics">a fortiori,</hi></foreign> we could not when at peace deny them to friendly nations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" /> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> named concession was proposed on the grounds already mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />We are still ready to guarantee these rights by convention with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, whenever she shall authorize either you or her Minister here to enter into convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />There is no reservation or difficulty about their application in the present case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" />We hold all the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, loyal or disloyal, alike included by the law of nations and treaties; and we hold ourselves bound by the same obligations to see, so far as may be in our power, that all our citizens, whether maintaining this Government or engaged in overthrowing it, respect those rights in favor of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and of every other friendly nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />In any case, not only shall we allow no privateer or national vessel to violate the rights of friendly nations as I have thus described them, but we shall also employ all our naval force to prevent the insurgents from violating them, just as much as we do to prevent them from violating the laws of our own country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" /> What, then, does <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> claim of us that we do not accord to her?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />Nothing. What do we refuse to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> by declining to receive the communication sent to us through the hands of <persName n="Mercier,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Mercier,nomatch:0" authname="mercier"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Mercier</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />Nothing but the privilege of telling us that we are at war when we maintain we are at peace, and that she is neutral when we prefer to recognize her as a friend. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47" /> Of course, it is understood that on this occasion we reserve, as on all others, our right to suppress the insurrection by naval as well as by military power, and for that purpose to close such of our ports as have fallen or may fall into the hands of the insurgents, either directly or in the more lenient and equitable form of a blockade, which for the present we have adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48" />It is thus seen that there is no practical subject of difference between the <num value="2">two</num> governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49" />The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will hope that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> will not think it necessary to adhere to and practice upon the speculation concerning the condition of our internal affairs which she has proposed to communicate to us. But, however this may be, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will not anticipate any occasion for a change of the relations which, with scarcely any interruption, have existed between the <num value="2">two</num> nations for <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a century, and have been very instrumental in promoting not merely the prosperity and greatness of each State, but the cause of civil and religious liberty and free institutions throughout the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50" /> This government understands equally the interest of friendly nations and its own in the present emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51" />If they shall not interfere, the attempt at revolution here will cease without inflicting serious evils upon foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52" />All that they can do by any interference, with a view to modify our action will only serve to prolong the present unpleasant condition of things, and possibly to produce results that would be as universally calamitous as they would be irretrievable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53" /> The case, as it now stands, is the simple, ordinary <num value="1">one</num> that has happened at all times and in all countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54" />A discontented domestic faction seeks foreign intervention to overthrow the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the liberties of its own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55" />Such intervention, if yielded is ultimately disastrous to the cause it is designed to aid. Every uncorrupted nation, in its deliberate movements, prefers its own integrity, even with unbearable evils, to division through the power or influence of any foreign State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56" />This is so in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57" />It is not less so in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58" />Down deep in the heart of the <rs>American</rs> people deeper than the love of trade or of freedom — deeper than the attachment to any local or sectional interest, or partisan pride or individual ambition — deeper than any other sentiment — is that out of which the constitution of this Union arose — namely, American independence — independence of all foreign control, alliance or influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59" />Next above it lies the conviction that neither peace, nor safety, nor public liberty, nor prosperity, nor greatness, nor empire, can be attained here with the sacrifice of the unity of the people of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001" authname="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60" />Those who, in a frenzy of passion, are building expectations on other principles do not know what they are doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61" />Whenever <num value="1">one</num> part of this Union shall be found assuming bonds of dependence or of fraternity towards any foreign people, to the exclusion of the sympathies of their native land, then, even if not before, that spirit will be reawakened which brought the <name>States</name> of this republic into existence, and which will preserve them united until the common destiny which it opened to them shall be fully and completely realized. </p> <closer> <salute>I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,</salute> <lb /> <signed><persName n="Seward,,William,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Seward,William,H.,," authname="seward,william,h."><foreName n="William" full="yes">Wm.</foreName> <foreName full="yes">H.</foreName>  <surname full="yes">Seward</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb /> <signed><persName n="Dayton,,William,L.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Dayton,William,L.,," authname="dayton,william,l."><foreName full="yes">William</foreName> <foreName full="yes">L.</foreName>  <surname full="yes">Dayton</surname></persName>,</signed> &amp;c., &amp;c. </closer> </div4> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="3" />

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71" /> The obscurity of the text of the declaration which <persName n="Thouvenel,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Thouvenel,nomatch:0" authname="thouvenel"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Thouvenel</surname></persName> submits to us is sufficiently relieved by his verbal explanations.--According to your report of the conversation, before referred to, he said that both <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> had already announced that they would take no part in our domestic controversy, and they thought a frank and open declaration in advance of the execution of the projected convention might save difficulty and misconception hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72" />He further said, in the way of specification, that the provisions of the convention standing alone might bind <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> to pursue and punish the privateers of the <rs>South</rs> as pirates; that they are unwilling to do this, and had so declared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73" />He said, also, that we could deal with these people as we choose, and they (<placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>) could only express their regrets on the score of humanity, if we should deal with them as pirates, but that they could not participate in such a course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74" />He added that although <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> are anxious to have adhesion of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0" authname="paris"><surname full="yes">Paris</surname></persName>, yet that they would rather dispense with it altogether than be drawn into our domestic controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75" />He insisted somewhat pointedly that we could take no just exception to this outside declaration, to be made simultaneously with the execution of the convention, unless we intended that they (<placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>) shall be made parties to our controversy, and that the very facts of your hesitation was an additional reason why they should insist upon making such contemporaneous declarations as they proposed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76" /> These remarks of <persName n="Thouvenel,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Thouvenel,nomatch:0" authname="thouvenel"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Thouvenel</surname></persName> are certainly distinguished by entire frankness.

<list type="ordered"> 
<head /> 
<item n="1"> <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79" />Privateering is and remains abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81" />Neutral goods, with the exception of contraband of war, are not liable to capture under enemy's flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82" /></item> 
<item n="4"> <num value="4">4</num>. Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective — that is to say, maintained by forces sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83" /></item> </list> 
<p> The States which constituted the <rs>Congress</rs> mutually agreed to submit the declaration to all other nations, and invite them to accede to it. It was to be submitted as no special or narrow treaty between particular States for limited or special purposes of advantage, or under peculiar circumstances; but, on the contrary, its several articles were by voluntary acceptance by maritime powers to constitute a new chapter in the law of nations, and each <num value="1">one</num> of the articles was to be universal and eternal in its application and obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84" /><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> especially invited the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to accede to these articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85" />An invitation was actually tendered to all other civilized nations, and the articles have been already adopted by <num value="41">forty-one</num> of the powers thus invited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86" />The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> hesitated, but only for the purpose of making an effort to induce the other parties to enlarge the beneficent scope of the declaration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87" /> Having failed in that effort, they now, after a delay not unusual in such great international discussions, offer their adhesion to that declaration, pure and simple, in the form, words and manner in which it was originally adopted and accepted by all of the <num value="46">forty-six</num> nations which have become parties to it. <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> declines to receive that adhesion unless she be allowed to make a special declaration, which would constitute an additional and qualifying article, limiting the obligations of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to a narrower range than the obligations which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> must assume towards <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and towards every other <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="46">forty-six</num> sovereigns who are parties to it, and narrower than the mutual obligations of all those parties, including <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> herself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88" /> If we should accede to that condition, it manifestly would not be the declaration of the <orgName n="Paris Congress" type="congress">Congress of Paris</orgName> to which we would be adhering, but a different and special and peculiar treaty between <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89" />Even as such a treaty it would be unequal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90" />Assuming that <persName n="Thouvenel,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Thouvenel,nomatch:0" authname="thouvenel"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Thouvenel</surname></persName>'s reasoning is correct, we should, in that case, be contracting an obligation, directly or indirectly, to implicate ourselves in any internal conflict that may now be existing, or that may hereafter occur in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, while she would be distinctly excused by us from any similar duty towards the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91" /> I know that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> is a friend, and means to be just and equal towards the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92" />I must assume, therefore, that she means not to make an exceptional arrangement with us, but to carry out the same arrangement in her interpretation of the obligations of the declaration of the <orgName n="Paris Congress" type="congress">Congress of Paris</orgName> in regard to other Powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93" />Thus carried out, the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0" authname="paris"><surname full="yes">Paris</surname></persName> would be expounded so as to <sic>excclude</sic> all internal conflicts in States from the application of the articles of that celebrated declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94" />Most of the wars of modern times — perhaps of all times — have been insurrectionary wars, or <q direct="unspecified">"internal conflicts."</q> If the position now assumed by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> should thus be taken by all the other parties to the declaration, then it would follow that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> article of that instrument, instead of being, in fact, a universal and effectual inhibition of the practice of privateering, would abrogate it only in wars between foreign nations, while it would enjoy universal toleration in civil and social wars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95" /> With great deference I cannot but think that, thus modified, the declaration of the <orgName n="Paris Congress" type="congress">Congress of Paris</orgName> would lose much of the reverence which it has hitherto received from <name>Christian</name> nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96" />If it were proper for me to pursue the argument further, I might add that addition, insurrection and treason would find in such a new reading of the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0" authname="paris"><surname full="yes">Paris</surname></persName>, encouragement which would tend to render the most stable and even the most beneficent systems of government insecure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97" />Nor do I know on what grounds it can be contended that practices more destructive to property and life ought to be tolerated in civil or fratricidal wars than are allowed in wars between independent nations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98" /> I cannot, indeed, admit that the engagement which <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> is required to make, without the qualifying declaration in question, would directly or indirectly implicate her in our internal conflicts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99" />But if such should be its effect, I must, in the first place, disclaim any desire for such an intervention on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100" />The whole of this long correspondence has had for <num value="1">one</num> of its objects the purpose of averting any such intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101" />If, however, such an intervention would be the result of the unqualified execution of the <rs>Convention</rs> by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, then the fault clearly must be inherent in the declaration of the <orgName n="Paris Congress" type="congress">Congress of Paris</orgName> itself, and it is not a result of anything that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have done or proposed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102" /> <num value="2">Two</num> motives induced them to tender their adhesion, to that declaration--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, a sincere desire to co-operate with other progressive nations in the amelioration of the rigors of maritime war; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, a desire to relieve <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> from any apprehension of danger to the lives or property of her people from violence to occur in the course of the civil conflict in which we are engaged, by giving her, unasked, all the guarantees in that respect which are contained in the declaration of the <orgName n="Paris Congress" type="congress">Congress of Paris</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103" />The latter of those <num value="2">two</num> motives is now put to rest, insomuch as <milestone unit="column" n="4" /> <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> declines the guarantees we offer.--Doubtless she is satisfied that they are unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104" />We have always practiced on the principles of the declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105" />We did so long before they were adopted by the <orgName n="Paris Congress" type="congress">Congress of Paris</orgName>, so far as the right of neutrals or friendly States are concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106" />While our relations with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> remain as they now are, we shall continue the same practice none the less faithfully than if bound to do so by a solemn convention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107" /> The other and higher motive will remain unsatisfied, and it will lose none of its force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108" />We shall be ready to accede to the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0" authname="paris"><surname full="yes">Paris</surname></persName> with every Power that will agree to adopt its principles for the government of its relations to us, and which shall be content to accept our adhesion on the same basis upon which all the other parties to it have acceded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109" /> We know that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france" authname="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> has a high and generous ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110" />We shall wait for her to accept hereafter that co-operation, on our part, in a great reform which she now declines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111" />We shall not doubt that, when the present embarrassment which causes her to decline this co-operation shall have been removed, as it soon will be, she will then agree with us to go still further, and abolish the confiscation of property of non-belligerent citizens and subjects in maritime war. </p>
