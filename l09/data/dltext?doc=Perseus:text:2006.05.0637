<milestone unit="sentence" n="55" />But this spectacle, which does so much honor to their courage, is only given at the price of numberless calamities and a prodigious effusion of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56" />To these results of civil war, which, from the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, assumed vast proportions, there is still to be added the apprehension of servile war, which would be the culminating point of so many irreparable disasters.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60" /> As you are aware, when the conflict commenced, we held it our duty to observe the most strict neutrality in concert with other maritime Powers, and the <rs>Washington Cabinet</rs> has repeatedly acknowledged the honorable manner with which we adhere to that line of conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61" />The sentiments dictated to us have undergone no change but of a benevolent character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62" />That neutrality, instead of imposing upon the <name>Powers</name> the attitude which might resemble indifference, ought rather to make them of service to the <num value="2">two</num> parties by helping them out of a position which seems to have no issue — From the commencement of the war an armed force was set on foot by the belligerents which, since then, has been almost constantly kept up.--After so much bloodshed they are now, in that respect, nearly in the same position, nothing authorizing the presumption that more decisive military operations will shortly occur, according to the last news received in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63" />The <num value="2">two</num> armies on the contrary, were in a condition that would not allow either party to hope within a brief delay for any decided advantage to turn the balance and accelerate the conclusion of a peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64" /> All these circumstances, taken together, point to the opportunity of an armistice, to which, moreover, under the present circumstances, no strategical objection can be made.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68" /> The overtures, I need not say, sir, would not imply, on our part, any judgment on the origin or issue of the struggle nor any pressure upon the negotiations which might, it is to be hoped, ensue in favor of an armistice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71" />Would not, moreover an agreement between the three Courts respond sufficiently to their intentions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72" />Would it not give to their step the character of evident impartiality?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73" />Acting in concert, they would combine the conditions best suited to inspire confidence — the government of the <rs>Emperor</rs> by the constant tradition of <name>French</name> policy towards the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--<placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, by the community of race — <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya" authname="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, by the marks of friendship she has never ceased to show to the <rs>Washington Cabinet</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74" />Should the event not justify the hope of the <num value="3">three</num> Powers, and should the ardor of the struggle over rule the wisdom of the councils, this attempt would not be the less honorable for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75" />They would have fulfilled a duty of humanity, more especially indicated in a war which has excited passions which render all direct attempts at negotiation more difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76" />It is the mission which international law assigns neutrals, at the same time that it prescribes to them a strict impartiality, and they could never make a nobler use of their influence by endeavoring to put an end to a struggle which causes so much suffering and compromises such great interests throughout the whole world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77" /> Finally, even without immediate results, these overtures would not be entirely useless, for they might encourage public opinion to views of conciliation, and thus contribute to hasten the moment when the return of peace might become possible. </p>
