<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />We wish to speak frankly and truthfully to you of the actual condition of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48" />We will not stop to inquire into the causes of an evil which we have so much reason to deplore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49" />The remedy is partly in the hands of Congress, and it is our province to apply it. But it is partly, also, in yours, and we appeal to you to use it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86" />Let us take it for granted at once that great results are always due to a great cause; never to a small <num value="1">one</num>--in other words, an incident insignificant in appearance never leads to great results without a pre-existing cause, which has allowed that small incident to achieve a great result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87" />A spark does not create a great conflagration unless it falls upon combustible materials accumulated beforehand." </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88" /> From such premises he infers that if the <name>Romans</name>, for nearly a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure>, always came forth from the severest trials that any nation was ever subjected to, superior to their adversaries, it was because there was some general cause which rendered them superior to their enemies, and did not permit defeats and partial cause to interrupt their sway.--In the same way, if the <name>Romans</name>, after having, under the influence of liberty, overrun and subdued nearly the whole of the world then known, have, since the time of Cæsar, been prone to slavery and serfdom in all their degrading forms, it is because there was a general reason for it. "It is," says the <rs>Emperor</rs>, "because the wants and the interests of a society in labor required other means to be satisfied." In other words, the <rs>Roman</rs> people were no longer what they had been in by-gone days.--The conquest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas" authname="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, of the <rs>East</rs>, and of <placeName reg="Carthage, Jasper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058276" authname="tgn,2058276">Carthage</placeName>, had let in a flood of luxury and wealth which had utterly corrupted the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90" />The people had begun to think all about property, and nothing about liberty; and it is a melancholy truth, illustrated by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> modern examples, that when the love of money has once gained the ascendant, every evil that can flow from a total depravation of manners is but too apt to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274" />After ascertaining all the facts bearing on this subject, your committee believe that what was done under the circumstances will meet a verdict of approval from all whose prejudices do not blind them to the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298" />It is doubtless true that, notwithstanding these facilities, many of the prisoners were lousy and filthy; but it was the result of their own habits, and not of neglect in the discipline or arrangements of the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310" />This was the habit of his though.
