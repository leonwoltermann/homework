<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />A few months more will, perhaps, suffice to consume it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />This should be an incentive to the farmers in that section of the <rs>State</rs> to engage in the cultivation of the sorghum, as it will enable them to have their molasses made without the expense of purchasing the apparatus requisite to its manufacture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357" />The authenticity of these is fully established by that high-minded and gallant officer, <persName n="Lee,General,Fitzhugh,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="default:Lee,Fitzhugh,,," authname="lee,fitzhugh"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Fitzhugh</foreName> <surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName>, who states that there was no opportunity of altering them unless by the courier who was dispatched with them, and that there was no writing whatever interlined in them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358" /> It is important that this document should be carefully preserved; that it should be put in a place where none of the numerous spies, villains, and other Federal employees in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> could lay their fingers upon it, and also be secure from incendiarism; for the late destructive fire near the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, which was near involving that building in the surrounding ruins, would have more than paid the <rs>Yankee</rs> operators if the <name>Department</name> had contained nothing else but <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0" authname="dahlgren"><surname full="yes">Dahlgren</surname></persName>'s Orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359" />For the present nation of this private document no ordinary vigilance should be exercised.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361" /> At the same time, it is equally important that the civilized world should be placed in possession of the facts demonstrating its authenticity, so that the unparalleled villains by whom it was planned shall not have the opportunity of escaping the responsibility of their crimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362" />We would especially invite the attention of representatives of foreign powers and intelligent visitors from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> to this manuscript in <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0" authname="dahlgren"><surname full="yes">Dahlgren</surname></persName>'s own hand, so as to give them an opportunity, by personal inspection, to judge for themselves the shallow <name>Yankee</name> evasion of forgery and interlineation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363" />It would also be well to multiply fac simile copies, which, with official attestation of their accuracy should at once be sent abroad. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364" /> With reference to those orders of <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0" authname="dahlgren"><surname full="yes">Dahlgren</surname></persName>, already published, the <rs>Yankees</rs> pretend that the application of the torch so freely directed therein was only intended for public buildings, and that the order to kill the <rs>President</rs> and Cabinet was a rebel interpolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365" />No <num value="1">one</num> can read those orders, flow over, without being satisfied that the universal destruction of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, "that hated city," was the object, and this is put beyond all doubt by the language of the private memorandum book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366" />The reserve must "go up the principal streets, and <hi rend="italics">destroying everything before them," "you must encourage the prisoners to destroy the city make <num value="1">one</num> vast flame of it."</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367" /> The other part, in regard to the killing of the <rs>President</rs> and Cabinet, is also placed beyond question by the private memorandum book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368" />A Philadelphia journal, in laboring to propagate the idea that the order to kill the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Officer">chief officers</rs> of the <rs>Government</rs> was a rebel interlineation, remarked that <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0" authname="dahlgren"><surname full="yes">Dahlgren</surname></persName> would have been only too proud to bear off the rebel <rs>President</rs> and his Cabinet prisoners to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369" />This might be true of most officers of the regular armies, and perhaps of <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0" authname="dahlgren"><surname full="yes">Dahlgren</surname></persName> also, but who is there so absurd as to suppose that the orders of <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0" authname="dahlgren"><surname full="yes">Dahlgren</surname></persName> were issued on his own responsibility?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371" />The reason why <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0" authname="dahlgren"><surname full="yes">Dahlgren</surname></persName> was directed to kill the <rs>President</rs> and Cabinet instead of making them prisoners, was simply to avoid all the difficulties and the possibility of their ultimate escape which would arise from reserving them for trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372" />It would be a very inconvenient thing to have <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,," authname="davis,jefferson"><foreName n="Jefferson" full="yes">Jeff.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Davis</surname></persName> alive on their hands, and the possibility of some very important prisoners coming into ours, who would be dealt with in like manner.--But the private memorandum book of <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0" authname="dahlgren"><surname full="yes">Dahlgren</surname></persName> settles this question also. "<hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Jeff Davis, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2000371" authname="tgn,2000371">Jeff Davis</placeName> and Cabinet must be killed on the spot.</hi>" These are its precise words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373" />Indeed, after devoting a city crowded with helpless women and children to the sack (confessed as <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0" authname="kilpatrick"><surname full="yes">Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s objects while the expedition was in progress) and to "<num value="1">one</num> vast flame," the killing of the <rs>President</rs> and Cabinet could not heighten the enormity of their wickedness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374" /> No reasoning is needed to satisfy ourselves of the reality of plans which are before our own eyes in <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0" authname="dahlgren"><surname full="yes">Dahlgren</surname></persName>'s own handwriting, which were found upon his dead body, and the authenticity of which is established by <persName n="Lee,General,Fitzhugh,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="default:Lee,Fitzhugh,,," authname="lee,fitzhugh"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Fitzhugh</foreName> <surname full="yes">Lee</surname></persName>.
