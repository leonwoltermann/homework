<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9" /> We stated briefly a few days ago some moral and fanciful reasons why the great battle in which <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,J.,," authname="jackson,thomas,j."><surname full="yes">Jackson</surname></persName> fell should be called the <hi rend="smallcaps"><rs n="Battle of the Wilderness" type="battle">Battle of the Wilderness</rs>.</hi> The matter of fact, however, is stronger than anything else in behalf of the name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" />The great battle was <hi rend="italics">really fought in the <rs>Wilderness</rs></hi>--a country of gravelly clay soil, and a black-jack growth, presenting in many places an almost impenetrable thicket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />There were occasional small openings of cleared and cultivated fields, in which the enemy had his works for defence.--The position was <num value="1">one</num> of great strength and was very probably alluded to by <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0" authname="hooker"><surname full="yes">Hooker</surname></persName> a short time since as <num value="1">one</num> he knew of, from which the whole <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> could not dislodge him. If he thought he knew such an <num value="1">one</num> he would certainly go to it, and no doubt did, in preference to all others accessible to him. It was indeed a strong <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />Yet <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129" authname="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s impetuous charge in the very jaws of death, as it were, could not be resisted by the <rs>Yankees</rs>, and they were driven from it. The name "<placeName key="tgn,7017622" n="1.000 715" reg="wilderness, spotsylvania, virginia" authname="tgn,7017622">Wilderness</placeName>" will perpetuate the nature of the position thus heroically stormed and carried — it will commemorate the last great fight of that Hero of many bloody fields whose last achievement was his greatest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" /> On the other hand, "<placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia" authname="tgn,7017621">Chancellorsville</placeName>" is the name of a place with only <num value="1">one</num> dwelling-house situated several miles from the great fight of the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> combat; and unsuggestive as it is at best, it could not therefore be applied with topographical truthfulness to designate the bloody struggle with the ruthless invader. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" /> The reply of <persName><roleName n="Earl" full="yes">Earl</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Russell</foreName></persName> being general, we are not informed as to the exact nature of the communication to the <rs>Washington Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />His mild language about it as "a representation of the facts," would suggest the inference that it was not very <hi rend="italics">sharp;</hi> that it was hardly up to the example of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> itself, when it not only demanded that the <rs>British Government</rs> should disapprove <persName n="Crampton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Crampton,nomatch:0" authname="crampton"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Crampton</surname></persName>'s (British Minister to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>) agency in the matter of enlisting troops in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for the <name>Crimean</name> war, but that it should withdraw <persName n="Crampton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Crampton,nomatch:0" authname="crampton"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Crampton</surname></persName> from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />Members of Parliament are urged to be cautions — to weigh their words — not to make too many inquiries about British and American relations — and not to say anything offensive and calculated to wound the sensibilities of a people whom <num value="1">one</num> of them has the boldness to call an "upstart race." </p> </div3>
