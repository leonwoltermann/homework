<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />Meetings of citizens are held almost daily, and money is liberally subscribed to the bounty fund; yet even this bait fails to tempt the poorer classes, who frequently answer the appeals to their patriotism by asking the wealthy men why they do not get an example by enlisting themselves!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />Criminals have been released from prison on condition of their joining the army, and every possible subterfuge is resorted to in the hope of avoiding a general draft; but the impression is that the quota of <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 8170" reg="massachusetts" authname="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> can not be furnished by any other means, and hence the newspapers are laboring to convince the public mind of the peculiar advantages of a measure which the masses universally condemn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />A statement has been put in circulation that <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men have already volunteered in the several States, but this was so utterly at variance with the truth that a <orgName n="New York Journal" type="newspaper">New York journal</orgName> refused to give it currency, and came out with a flat contradiction. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51" />Officers and privates were subjected to the same fare, which consisted of a small allowance of sour bread and salt meat twice a day, with an occasional introduction of very weak soup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52" />The Government allowance for rations purports to be <measure n="16cents" type="currency">sixteen cents</measure> a day for each prisoner; but it was stated in a Philadelphia newspaper that <persName n="Gibson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Gibson,nomatch:0" authname="gibson"><roleName n="Captain" full="yes">Capt.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Gibson</surname></persName>, by <q direct="unspecified">"his excellent management,"</q> saved about <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of this sum, and expended it in clothing, which the prisoners never received the benefit of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53" />Until the exchange of prisoners was agreed upon they were not allowed to receive newspapers; but whenever the commandant of the fort found anything especially adverse to the cause of the <rs>South</rs>, he would cut it out and send it to the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers for the purpose of irritating them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54" />In consequence of an impression that the prisoners were forming a plan to take possession of the fort, an attempt was made to conciliate them with information that they were about to be paroled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57" />No communication was allowed between the officers and privates, except by special permission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58" />Every inducement was offered privates to take the oath of allegiance and enlist in the <rs>Federal</rs> army; and it was not uncommon for the officers to propose a bribe of from <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">$200</measure> to <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> in gold to effect his purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59" />Thus <num value="271">271</num> were induced to take the oath, but of this number not <num value="1">one</num> was a native of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.
