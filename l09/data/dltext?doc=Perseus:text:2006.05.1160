<milestone unit="sentence" n="71" /> On the <date value="1863-07-22" authname="1863-07-22">22d of July, 1863,</date> the <name>Cartel</name> of Exchange was agreed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72" />The chief, if not only, purpose of that instrument was to secure the release of all prisoners of war. To that and, the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> article provides that all prisoners of war should be discharged on parole in <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> after their capture, and that the prisoners then held, and those thereafter taken, should be transported to the points mutually agreed upon at the expense of the capturing party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73" />The <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> article also stipulates that "all prisoners, of whatever arm of service, are to be exchanged or paroled in <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> from the time of their capture, if it be practicable to transfer them to their own lines in that time; if not, as soon thereafter as practicable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75" />During that interval, deliveries were made as fast as the <rs>Federal Government</rs> furnished transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76" />Indeed, upon more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion I urged the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities to send increased means of transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77" />As ready as the enemy always has been to bring false accusations against us, it has never been alleged that we failed or neglected to make prompt deliveries of prisoners who were not under charges when we held the excess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78" />On the other hand, during the same time, the cartel was openly and notoriously violated by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79" />Officers and men were kept in cruel confinement, sometimes in irons or doomed cells, without charges or trial. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80" /> In <date value="1863-07" authname="1863-07">July, 1863,</date> the enemy, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time since the adoption of the cartel, held the excess of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81" />As soon as that fact was ascertained, whenever a delivery was made by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities they demanded an equal number in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82" />I endeavored frequently to obtain from the <rs>Federal</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Agent of Exchange">Agent of Exchange</rs> a distinct avowal of the intentions of his Government as to the delivery of prisoners, but in vain.
