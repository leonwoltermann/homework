<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />Let there is no divisions, I exhort you; this is not the time for the manifestation of personal preferences. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" /> To return to this <orgName n="Congressional committee" type="committee">Congressional Committee</orgName>, it is all trickery and subterfuge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />They don't mean to do anything, and, they can't do anything — for they haven't started right; they haven't begun at the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />They are perfecting points of detail, when the vital principle of concession has not been touched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />I was in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> a few days, and spoke with gentlemen on that Committee, to whom I took the liberty of suggesting a resolution similar to that since proposed by <persName n="Crawford,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Crawford,William,,,:1" authname="crawford,william"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Crawford</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248" authname="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, recognizing the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> as it is recognized in the <rs>Constitution</rs> and in the decisions of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />Well, let them attempt to press that resolution, and that moment the <rs>Committee</rs> will explode.--The men from the <rs>North</rs> will never cede that right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />They'll try to delay action till <dateStruct value="-01-" full="yes" authname="--01"><month reg="01" full="yes">January</month></dateStruct> or <dateStruct full="yes"><month full="yes">May</month></dateStruct>, but they will never yield the right of slavery, which they deny upon their consciences, and which we, on our consciences, <unclear />--a right which we will never agree to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />Never. [Applause] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" /> But suppose they should patch up a compromise, what will it be worth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />Haven't compromises been made before, and violated with impunity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />Hasn't the <name>Constitutional</name> right to recover slaves been trampled under foot?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30" />Hasn't the <rs>Congressional Fugitive Slave</rs> law been trampled under foot?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />Hasn't the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> been trampled under foot?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />And all of these having been done time and again by a dozen States, what need of going further?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />If they won't believe <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0" authname="moses"><surname full="yes">Moses</surname></persName> and the <name>Prophets</name>, neither will they believe <num value="1">one</num> though risen from the dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" /> Another remedy suggested is revolution — but revolution <hi rend="italics">within</hi> the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />That idea is beyond human comprehension, I think, and no need not be now discussed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" /> Calling a Convention of the <rs>Slave States</rs> is the popular remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />[Applause.] But even if feasible as a remedy, such a Convention would be in direct violation of the spirit and of the letter of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and we in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522" authname="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> oppose it on that account, and because it is not adequate for good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />Such a Convention could not assemble before the <date value="03-04" authname="3-04">4th of March.</date> The Legislatures of the several States would <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> have to be convened, then separate State Conventions called, and finally the <orgName n="General Convention" type="misc">general Convention</orgName> would have to assemble and — debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />But even if the <rs>Convention</rs> could be got together before the <date value="03-04" authname="3-04">4th of March,</date> the probability is that <num value="2">two</num> States at least--<placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516" authname="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826" authname="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>--could not from peculiar circumstances, be represented in it. But the plan is an impracticable <num value="1">one</num>--the <rs>Convention</rs> could only meet with a purpose of preparing for disunion; called with any other purpose it would be futile, and a disunion Convention, <unclear /> need not say, is in violation of the spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />The States have no right to go out together — no <num value="1">one</num> asserts any such right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />Each State must go out by herself and in the exercise of her separate State sovereignty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42" /> The only available remedy for our oppression which the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522" authname="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName> can suggest, is that each State shall secede from the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" /> [A stormy scene followed the last remark of the speaker, a violent storm of hisses being met by a counter-blast of cheers, though the former largely predominated, and was pertinaciously continued after the applause had subsided into an occasional individual shout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />After a calm of a few seconds the tempest of hisses and applause was resumed with renewed force, parties on the floor of the hall endeavoring to make up in the energy of their demonstrations — waving of hats and stamping of feet — for the deficiency in their vocal rivalry of the hisses from the galleries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45" />The excitement bid fair to culminate in a row, and the parties were mounting the seats for the purpose of witnessing that expected result, when a cry of "Turn out that — Black Republican" concentrated the attention of the meeting upon an individual near the centre of the hall, who was vigorously hustled out and quiet was again restored, when <num value="3">three</num> cheers were called for "<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712" authname="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>." They were given with a will; cheers for <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522" authname="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> were also given, and a call for "<num value="3">three</num> cheers for <persName n="Hicks,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Hicks,nomatch:0" authname="hicks"><roleName n="Governor" full="yes">Governor</roleName> <surname full="yes">Hicks</surname></persName>" was responded to with a mingled chorus of cheers, hisses and groans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46" />Cheers for the "<placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>" were also given.] </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48" />[Vociferous cheering] I am here to speak words of truth, and reason soberly and respectfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49" />If they prove unpleasant, reject them; but I ask to be heard with respect and consideration, and not to be put off with the clamor of prejudice and preconceived opinions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50" /> <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522" authname="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> has her rights under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and if violated, as they have been, she conceives it to be not only her right, but her duty to resume her sovereign powers and to withdraw from this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77" />To both the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern States we beg to suggest what has happened in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78" />A few years ago all <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> went crying mad over a story which certainly was a master piece of writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81" />What is now the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82" />We are a fair and reasoning people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83" />We have looked into the condition of the <name>Negro</name>, as described by the novelist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84" />We have "realized" the "institution. " We have apprehended the greatness of the facts, and ask ourselves, "What can be done?"

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85" />There is no use in violent language, we say to ourselves; what is to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86" />That is the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88" /> Returning thus to our senses, to our reason, and to our conscience, we have come to take a much quieter view of the "domestic institution." We feel for the slaves, but we feel also for the masters, and we have satisfied ourselves that it does no good to the former to abuse the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89" />We are aware, too, that slavery was a British bequest to the <name>States</name>. --All these considerations apply quite as much, and more nearly by several degrees to the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<head>Still more about dogs.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346" /> A deep gloom seems to have settled on everything around us. The near prospect of troubles — the beginning of which we shall all, the end of which we shall none of us see, seems to have dried up the very fountains of mirth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347" />To smile, seems strange and unnatural; to laugh, is almost impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348" />We have a divine warrant for saying that the house of mourning is better than the house of mirth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349" />We have none for considering it more agreeable.--Seeing, however, that it is so, we are all better off than we ever were before, since never before was there such cause for mourning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350" />It may sound harsh and discordant to strike, at this moment, any other key than that which brings forth a note of lamentation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351" />But the human mind needs relief, and human sorrow cannot last forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352" />To divert our own wretched feelings, and to call away the attention of our readers, if but for a moment, from a subject of unlimited distress, we have determined to write another chapter on dogs.--They are more important personages than seems to be generally imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353" />They gave name to a school of philosophers, (Cynics,) we think somewhat unjustly.--The Cynics seem to have been mere snarlers, while dogs, in general, are something much better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354" />The Cynics spent their lives in mocking at man. Dogs are the most faithful companions that man has. The Cynics were cold-hearted, cold-blooded, selfish, and indifferent to all suffering but their own. The dog is warm-hearted, unselfish, sympathetic, feels his master's sufferings more than his own, will risk his life in his defence, and has been known to follow him into prison, to go with him to the scaffold, to lie down on his grave, and to die of a broken heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355" />Greatly superior, then is the dog to the <name>Cynic</name>, and nothing can be more palpable than the misnomer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356" />The crooked tyrant did himself more credit than he deserved, when he said that at his birth the gossips cried-- </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364" />The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time we ever saw him he was in all his glory, the finest looking animal of the dog kind we ever beheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365" />He was a yellow pointer; tall, majestic, of noble presence, naughty carriage, a face full of intelligence, and eyes that flashed fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366" />When he moved, he carried his head in the air, like the great racer <persName><roleName n="Sir" full="yes">Sir</roleName> <foreName full="yes">Charles</foreName></persName>, (the most beautiful horse, we suspect, ever seen in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331" authname="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>,) and his step was light, noiseless and springey, like that of an Indian stepping upon the dry leaves of the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367" />We were sitting down reading, and expecting nothing less, when the gentleman in whose company he came burst into the room, and he along with him. His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> action was to come up and form my acquaintance; his next was to run all over the house to satisfy his curiosity with regard to the <hi rend="italics">fixins;</hi> lastly, he scoured the yard, the garden and the kitchen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368" />He took an inventory of everything, and, we have no doubt, set it down upon the tablet of his memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369" /><num value="1">One</num> of the famous dogs we have mentioned, old <hi rend="italics">Ludo,</hi> was occupant of the premises before his arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370" />Ludo was country bred, and did not relish the intrusion from the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371" />The new comer treated him somewhat with the insolence which, in the old country, the aristocracy are said to treat a parvenn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372" />He evidently set himself to quizzing the old fellow, who was somewhat surly, and being unused to company of his own species, knew no!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373" />how to take a joke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374" />He pricked up his ears as he approached him, smelt at him, wagged his tall in infinite glee as if saying "what a rum old customer it is." and when his highbred impertinence was rewarded with a snap or a snarl, jumped lightly out of the way, wagged his tail, arched his back, lifted up his head, and was no doubt convulsed with laughter, though we confess we never could tell exactly when a dog was laughing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375" />The <unclear /> was never staunched during the whole time of <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>'s sojourn.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377" /> Pride, we are told, goes before a fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378" /><rs type="role2">Prince</rs> experienced the truth of this maxim to his sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379" />Like others of his rank, he became a wanderer, and died in exile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380" />He was ambitious, and could not confine himself to a narrow sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381" />Nothing would do, but he must see the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382" />So <num value="1">one</num> fine morning he leaped into the cars, and went to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, to look, no doubt, after his brethren in both Houses of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383" />But, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384" />he was soon destined to feel the pressure of poverty in a strange land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385" />He had innumerable accomplishments — he could waltz like a <hi rend="italics">dansense</hi> of the theatre — he could be sent back any distance to find anything that was lost — he could sit up straight in a chair — he could run and leap over a stick or horsewhip — he could catch his tail in his mouth — he could do many other things at the word of command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386" />But he fell into the hands of a man who did not appreciate his talents or never called them forth, for he was too proud to volunteer any exhibition of them — We were walking, <num value="1">one</num> morning, on the canal in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387" />We felt something cold touch our hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388" />We turned around and beheld — <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390" /> "But, oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391" />how fallen, how changed." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392" /> He looked thin and gaunt, like a wolf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393" />His demeanor was humble, downcast and fawning — his gait was slouching and stealthy — his eye had lost all its fire, his carriage all its pride — he was the very picture of fallen greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394" />We thought of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName full="yes">Charles</foreName> <genName n="10" full="yes">X</genName></persName>.</hi> and the <name>Dey</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7001314" n="1.000 1" reg="alger,el djazair,al-jaza'ir,africa" authname="tgn,7001314">Algiers</placeName>, of the <rs type="place">House</rs> of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0" authname="stuart"><surname full="yes">Stuart</surname></persName></hi> and the <rs type="place">House</rs> of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bourbon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Bourbon,nomatch:0" authname="bourbon"><surname full="yes">Bourbon</surname></persName></hi>--of Beau <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Hickman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Hickman,nomatch:0" authname="hickman"><surname full="yes">Hickman</surname></persName></hi> and genius generally in distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395" />None of them were ever more seedy or disconsolate — none gave more unmistakable symptoms of the gentleman under a cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396" />He evidently knew us, and as evidently begged that we would follow him to his home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397" />We did so, and found he resided in the house of a man who sold liquor — as they call such a man in <placeName key="tgn,7007522" n="1.000 7" reg="mississippi" authname="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> — a doggery keeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398" />We enquired about him, and we found he had been asked for, but a fabulous price had been demanded for him, and so it was no bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399" />This was the last we ever saw of poor <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400" />His history encloses a moral quite as good as many a <num value="1">one</num> we have seen tacked on to the end of a less striking story. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401" /> We are naturally credulous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403" />The most veracious of mankind seem to think themselves justified <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> in telling big stories about these animals.-- Wonderful stories are told about <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>, because, we suppose, he was a wonderful dog.--He never, it is true, took up the wood to put on the fire, or whipped the puppies because they didn't help him. He slept by a coal fire and there were no puppies to whip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404" />But he was in the habit of waking up a servant girl, who slept in the same room, and making her put on the coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405" />On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when she attempted to leave the room without doing it, he interposed between her and the door, and would not let her go out until it was done. </p>
