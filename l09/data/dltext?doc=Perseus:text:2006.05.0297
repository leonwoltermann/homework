<milestone unit="sentence" n="9" /> --We stated yesterday our conviction that there would be no such thing as winter quarters during this war.--That either party will think of winter quarters, at least during the <hi rend="italics">present</hi> winter, is hardly probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10" />The <rs>Yankees</rs>, at any rate, profess to have laid out a splendid programme for the season, and unless it should be spoiled by some unfortunate repetition of the <rs>Bull Runness</rs>, they will carry it out. They speak as if there were no doubt about the success of their plan, even in the smallest particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />The misfortune with them is, that combated operations upon so large a scale require a <unclear /> at the head, and talents in the general departments, which they are ill able to furnish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />The troops must be veterans who will gand fire, not runners, who will trot off at the <unclear /> alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" />A plan so vast and complicated as that which they propose, was never carried <unclear /> any commander, not even by <hi rend="smallcaps"><unclear>Napo</unclear> </hi> It is more vast than the invasion of <unclear /> in <dateStruct value="1812--" full="yes" authname="1812"><year reg="1812" full="yes">1812</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />It must be remembered, likewise, that this is a stem consisting of so many parts, that the casters of failure are indefinitely multiplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17" />The machinery is so ingeniously constructed <unclear /> no <num value="1">one</num> part can be independent of the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />The failure of <num value="1">one</num> involves the destruction of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />But they are raising men to effect this object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />It lies in fact at the bottom of the whole war. By a steady and persistent course of wrong and insult, they drove away this great trade, which made them what they are or what they were <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> ago. They now begin to experience the consequences of their folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />Their commerce has been curtailed to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of its former proportions, their manufactures are gasping for life, their finances are becoming hopeless their whole country is on the verge of bankruptcy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />Now they would get back by the wrong hand what their folly drove away for no cause whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />There can be no doubt that though they have neither the wisdom nor the men to succeed in the vast plan which they are connecting, they will make desperate efforts this winter.
