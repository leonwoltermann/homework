<milestone unit="sentence" n="93" />I have read with special attention your remarks upon this subject, and have labored to impress upon the minds of our people its importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94" />Since I was <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> old I have been from time to time, roaming over the hills and through the valleys of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961" authname="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, in search of such game as infest our mountainous country, until to-day; I have no hesitancy in saying that <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> out of every <num value="30">thirty</num> squirrels I shoot at, will be stewed without an eye and a great portion of his head. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96" />This is no bragging, but is a simple fact, which I can prove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97" />And yet, I am far from being the best shot in the county; there are plenty more as good, if not better, than I am. Would it not be wrong to take this kind of material and put it in service where this knowledge would be useless?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98" />I think so. Another objection to the regular service is this: I, with many others, know nothing about military drill, literally nothing, and would be unfit to perform the duties of a soldier for months to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99" />But, accept us in our hunting garb, with our squirrel and deer guns upon our shoulders, and a good bowie-knife; relieve us of <q direct="unspecified">"shoulder arms,"</q><q direct="unspecified">"carry arms,"</q><q direct="unspecified">"mark time,"</q> &amp;c., &amp;c., and we'll promise that for every crack of our rifles a hated <name>Yankee</name> will bite the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100" />We are all accustomed to camp life in the mountains, the most of us being in the habit of going on a deer-hunting excursion once a year, and sleeping in the woods in all kinds of weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101" />But to place us in regular service, and throw around us all the arduous duties of a regular soldier, we would be no better than the man who never fired a gun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121" /> Camp duties have prevented my writing to you before this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122" />Having now a few hours' leisure, I avail myself of the opportunity to give you some information of things transpiring here, knowing that your entire community are anxiously awaiting authentic intelligence from us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123" /> If the hearts of our men needed inspiration, the tears of our wives, mothers, sisters, and which even bedewed the cheeks of iron manhood at parting from us, were enough to nerve them to do battle to the death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124" />Stirred as were our softer feelings for a while, the buoyancy of the soldier soon returned, and song after song beguiled the tedium of the journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125" />Along the route the greeting we received was a perfect ovation, and a <q direct="unspecified">"<name n="God" type="God">God</name> speed you"</q> was given to us from every farm-house and dwelling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126" />At each stopping place the train was surrounded by crowds of both sexes and all ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127" />Ebony faces peered from the fences, doffing their hats or bonnets, and making an enviable display of ivory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128" />Baskets filled with bouquets, confections, tobacco, etc.were borne along the platform from car to car, and their contents given to the soldiers by the fair hands of more lovely women than I had seen for the previous <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>. On reaching this place the <name>Regiment</name> immediately went into camp in a broad and gently undulating field, (said to be the property of the editor of the <orgName n="New York Sun" type="newspaper">New York Sun</orgName>) flanked by a beautiful wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129" />The sound of the axe and hammer broke the stillness of the <name>Sabbath</name> day, and in a few hours the white tents of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Regiment</orgName> of <orgName type="mil" key="VAVolunteer">Virginia Volunteers</orgName> were shining in the sun. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130" /> The country here is fair enough to look upon, but, much to our surprise, we soon found that water was scarce; that which we are able to get in the immediate vicinity of the camp is the color of the freestone strata through which it flows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131" />Of this mineral there seems to be an inexhaustible quantity, the entire soil partaking of its dull red color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132" />There is something of a village here, consisting of <num value="1">one</num> tavern, <num value="2">two</num> stores and several private dwellings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133" />Within the circuit of a mile or <num value="2">two</num> are several handsome residences. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134" /> There are numerous bodies of troops here, besides our regiment, among them <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Kershaw,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00165" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,nomatch:0" authname="kershaw"><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Col.</roleName><surname full="yes">Kershaw</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName>, not long since encamped in <placeName reg="Howards Grove, Rockingham, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2403820" authname="tgn,2403820">Howard's Grove</placeName>, near your city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135" />What our force is, of course I will not say; but, few or many, their numbers and resolution are sufficient to give any force that the enemy can well spare from their boasted <num value="1000">thousands</num> a welcome with bloody hands to hospitable graves.--There is no sickness of consequence among our men, and all are in excellent spirits, and rapidly acquitting that degree of proficiency in drill necessary to fit them for the art of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136" /> On <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, about <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time>, the intelligence spread like lightning through the camp that <num value="2">two</num> of our scouts, having approached too near <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269" authname="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, were killed, and that the enemy were rapidly moving upon us. Instantly every man was in arms, and in less than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour the ranks were formed and ready to march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137" />Not a cheek turned pale, not an arm was unnerved; but the bearing of each man bespoke every inch the soldier, and a thrill of almost savage joy went from heart to heart at the thought that the hour was near at hand to strike a blow for our homes, our loved ones, and our honor — an hour of terrible retribution for the many insults and wrongs inflicted upon a long suffering people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138" /> Never had I witnessed such a scene; never did the palmiest days of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas" authname="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> or <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102" authname="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> witness a grounder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139" />Men who had left their peaceful a vocations at the call of their country, all unused to scenes of bloody strife, whose only ambition had, perhaps, been to pass their lives in the midst of domestic tranquility, were, as if by the wand of some arch magician, transformed into heroes, not only ready, but eager to go forth and offer up their lives in defence of a principle as eternal as the heavens — the principle of <hi rend="italics">justice.</hi> No cheers <q direct="unspecified">"rent the air."</q> There was none of the loud talking and bluster with which the bully seeks to hide his fear; quietly and quickly falling into ranks, every man stood ready for the word of command, and within less than half an hour from the moment of the call to arms we were on our way to meet the foe. Our march could not have been more disagreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140" />The deep dust that filled the road was hurled into our faces in blinding clouds by a high wind, blinding and almost suffocating us. But this was almost unheeded, and our columns pressed rapidly on. Arriving at a small stream called <placeName reg="Bull Creek, Missouri, Missouri" key="tgn,2205444" authname="tgn,2205444">Bull Creek</placeName>, distant about <placeName><distance reg="4miles" full="yes" exact="U">four miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877" authname="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName></placeName>, the command was given to halt, in order to allow us a few moments to get water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141" />While there, we were met by a portion of the <orgName type="mil" key="SCRegiment">S. C. Regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142" />They had preceded us several hours in anticipation of a fight and were then returning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143" />From them we learned that the rumored killing of our scouts and the advance of the enemy were unfounded, everything being quiet ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144" />Great was their disappointment and our own, and throwing themselves upon the grass under the protecting shade of the beautiful wood that bordered the pretty little stream, our men gave free expression to their regret that they were not yet to have a brush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147" /><num value="3">Three</num> cheers and a <q direct="unspecified">"tiger"</q> testified the pleasure of our men at this compliment as the <rs>General</rs> rode away towards camp, whither we soon followed him, and from which I hope to date a few more letters. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283" /> It is a most singular thing that a section which has been so very clamorous, for so many years, against admitting any more slave territory, should now make so great a virtue of compelling slave territory to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284" />The South simply desires to take the <rs>Northern Abolitionists</rs> at their word, and to rid them of association with slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285" />We simply desire to grant the <rs>Northern</rs> politicians what they have been clamorous for a long time, by ending the <q direct="unspecified">"irrepressible conflict,"</q> and letting their Union be <q direct="unspecified">"all free."</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286" /> Their whole military movement at this hour is in conflict with their professed principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287" />If they are answerable for the sin of slavery in the <rs>Union</rs>, we propose to relieve them of the sin by moving out of the <rs>Union</rs>; and their war upon us is for the purpose of preventing the act of absolution which they have clamored for and we are anxious to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288" />We have no desire that they should stand rebuked of Heaven for our delinquency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289" />We desire that they may appear before the eye of Christendom, the elect of <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName>, and at the bar of Heaven, in a pure white robe, unstained by the sin and blood of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290" />It is they who are refusing this good office we are endeavoring in their behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291" />It is they who reject the white robe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292" />It is they who insist upon farther dalliance and farther contamination with the anathematized institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293" />So long as the <rs>Union</rs> was voluntary and federal, they were not responsible for slavery, though fattening upon its earnings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294" />If they succeed in their present effort to maintain by force, to consolidate and to nationalize the <rs>Union</rs>, then they will be responsible for slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295" />They are not only endeavoring to retain slave territory in the <rs>Union</rs>, but they are bringing about a state of things in which they will be in fact what they have heretofore only pretended to be — responsible, morally and politically, for the damning institution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296" /> Strange as it is, however, it is not more strange than true, that the very section which last year voted by an overwhelming majority that there should be no more slave States, are this year moving Heaven and earth to retain slave States in the <rs>Union</rs> which are desperate to get out of it. What, then, is the meaning of this strange, illogical, unnatural war on the part of the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297" />It certainly is not a war of principle; for it is waged in violation of all the principles they have professed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298" />It is not a war of religion; for, as depraved, corrupt and fiendish a people as they, cannot have religious convictions or motives of conduct by any moral possibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299" />It is simply a war of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300" />They want the benefit of our trade; they want to continue in the enjoyment of that tribute of <num value="1000000">millions</num> which they have exacted from us for <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure>. They charge that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712" authname="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and the cotton States have been actuated by none but commercial motives in the course they have taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301" />Be it so; but we retort the charge upon themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302" />The war on their part is a war of avarice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303" />It is a war having its prompting in the same selfish motives which actuated <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445" authname="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in her contest with the colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307" />Precisely in the same relation, as to commerce and trade, have the <rs>Southern States</rs> stood to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308" />And this war of the <rs>North</rs> upon them is to perpetuate that relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309" />That is the object of the war; their motive is altogether selfish; it is the dictate of interest, it is the inspiration of avarice that hounds them on. Suddenly they own their abolitionism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310" />They industriously give out to the <rs>South</rs> that slaves will not be liberated or interfered with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844" />The rattling of their armor, and the muffled thunder of their tread, drowned all the roar of battle, as with firm, set array, and swift, steady motion, they bore down with their terrible front on the foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845" /> The shock of that immense host was like a falling mountain, and the front line of the <rs>Russian</rs> army went down like frost work before it. Then commenced a protracted fight of hand to hand, and sword to sword, as in the cavalry action at Eckmubl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846" />The clashing of steel was like the ringing of countless hammers, and horses and riders were blended in wild confusion together; the <rs>Russian</rs> reserve were ordered up, and on these <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00665" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0" authname="murat"><surname full="yes">Murat</surname></persName> fell with his fierce horsemen, crushing and trampling them down by <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847" />But the obstinate <rs>Russians</rs> disdained to fly, and rallied again and again, so that it was no longer cavalry charging on infantry, but squadrons of horse galloping through broken hosts that, gathering into knots, still disputed, with unparalleled bravery, the red and rent field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848" /> It was during this strange fight that <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00666" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0" authname="murat"><surname full="yes">Murat</surname></persName> was seen to perform <num value="1">one</num> of those desperate deeds for which he was so renowned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849" />Excited to the highest pitch of passion by the obstacles that opposed him, he seemed endowed with <num value="10">ten</num>-fold strength, and looked more like a superhuman being treading down helpless mortals than an ordinary man. Amid the roar of artillery, and rattling of musketry, and falling of sabre strokes like lightning about him, that lofty white plume never once went down, while ever and anon it was seen glaring through the smoke of battle, the star of hope to <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00667" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0" authname="napoleon"><surname full="yes">Napoleon</surname></persName>, and showing that his <q direct="unspecified">"right arm"</q> was still uplifted and striking for victory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850" /> He raged like an unloosed lion amid the foe; and his eyes, always terrible in battle, burned with increased lustre, while his clear and steady voice, heard above the turmoil of strife, was worth more than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> trumpets to cheer on his followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851" />At length, seeing a knot of <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00668" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0" authname="russian"><surname full="yes">Russian</surname></persName> soldiers that for a long time had kept up a devouring fire upon his men, he wheeled his horse and drove in full gallop upon their levelled muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852" />A few of his guards, that never allowed that white plume to leave their sight, charged after him. Without waiting to count his foes, he seized his bridle in his teeth, and with his pistol in <num value="1">one</num> hand and his drawn sword in the other, burst in headlong fury upon them, and scattered them as if a hurricane had swept by. <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00669" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0" authname="murat"><surname full="yes">Murat</surname></persName> was a thunderbolt on that day, and the deeds that were wrought by him will furnish themes for the poet and the painter." </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853" /> --The richest thing of the season, says the <orgName n="Newburyport Herald" type="newspaper">Newburyport Herald</orgName>, came off the other day, in the neighborhood of the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854" />The greatest <persName><foreName full="yes">Jonathan</foreName></persName> imaginable, decked out in a slouched hat, a long blue frock, and a pair of cowhide shoes, big as gondolas, with a huge whip under his arm, stalked in to a billiard saloon, where half a dozen persons were improving the time in trundling round the ivories, and, after recovering from his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> surprise at the to him singular aspect of the room, inquired if <q direct="unspecified">"any of'em had seen a stray steer,"</q> affirming that <q direct="unspecified">"the blasted critter got away as he came through town with his drove t'other day, and he hadn't seen nothin' on him since."</q> The bloods denied all knowledge of the animal in question, and with much sly winking at each other, proceeded to condole with him on his loss in the most heartfelt manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855" />He watched the game with much interest, as he had evidently never seen nor heard of anything of the kind before, and created much amusement by his demonstrations of applause when a good shot was made--<q direct="unspecified">"<placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg="," authname="possibilities=25">Jerusalem</placeName> !"</q> being a favorite interjection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856" />At last he made bold to request the privilege of trying his skill, when he set the crowd in a roar by his awkward movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857" />However, he gradually got his hand in, and played as well as could be expected for a greenhorn.-- All hands now began to praise him, which so elated him that he actually began to think himself a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <persName n="Phelan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00670" reg="mostcommon:Phelan,nomatch:0" authname="phelan"><surname full="yes">Phelan</surname></persName>, and he offered to bet a dollar with his opponent, which, of course, he lost, The loss and the laugh so irritated him that he offered to play another game and bet <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure>, which he pulled out of a big roll — for it seems his cattle had sold well and he was quite flush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858" />This bet he also lost, as the fool might have known he would; when, mad as a March hare, he pulled out a <num value="50">fifty</num> spot, the largest he had, and offered to bet that on another game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859" />The crowd mustered round and raised money enough to cover it, and at it they went again, when, by some strange turn of luck, the greeny won. He now offered to put up the <num value="100">hundred</num> he had won against another <num value="100">hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860" />Of course, he could not blunder into another game, so they could now win back what they had lost, and fleece the fellow of his own roll besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861" />They sent out for a famous player, who happened to have money enough to bet with; another game was played, when <persName><foreName full="yes">Jonathan</foreName></persName> won. Another <num value="100">hundred</num> was also raised, and bet and won; and it was not until he had blundered through half a dozen games, and by some un- </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862" /> accountable run of luck, won them all, draining the pockets of his opponents of about <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>, that they began to smell a very large <q direct="unspecified">"mice."</q> When everybody got tired of playing, gawky pulled his frock on over his head, took his whip under his arm and walked quietly out, turning round at the door and remarking, <q direct="unspecified">"Gentlemen if you should happen to see anything of that steer, I wish you'd let me know."</q> At last accounts they had not seen the steer, but they came to the conclusion that they saw the elephant. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
