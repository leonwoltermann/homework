<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" /> It is rational to conclude that this journal derives most of its intelligence from Northern sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />It never sees the full Southern side of the question.--An eminent Spanish General visited <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0" authname="mcclellan"><surname full="yes">McClellan</surname></persName>'s camp during the siege of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and was clear in the conviction that <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was a dead cock in the pit. We suggested at the time that it would be well for this Spanish Generalissimo to visit the <rs>Confederate</rs> as well as Federal camps before coming to so decisive a conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />The result proved that the highest military authority outside of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> may blunder egregiously, and is in great danger of blundering simply because it hears only <num value="1">one</num> side of the story; and whilst it sees the preparations for assault, knows nothing of the resources for defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" /> If the <rs>British</rs> <hi rend="italics">Army and Navy Gazette</hi> had been published during the war of the <name>Revolution</name>, it would, at a certain gloomy period of that struggle, have pronounced the defeat of the <rs>Americans</rs> inevitable, and with much better reason than it now prophecies the downfall of the <rs>South</rs>.

The <hi rend="italics">Gazette </hi> must be sadly ignorant of "the situation," and of the capacities of the <rs>South</rs> when it treats as problematical the existence of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> for another year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />We are stronger now than we were a year ago; glorious harvests; the currency improving; the tax bill bidding fair to yield an enormous revenue; our armies increasing every day in numbers and efficiency; our whole population, independent of the army, about to be organized into an embattled host.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />When therefore the <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi> speaks of <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0" authname="richmond"><surname full="yes">Richmond</surname></persName> as a <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">caput mortum,</hi></foreign> it is as much out of its reckoning as the <rs>Spanish General</rs> who confidently predicted its capture by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0" authname="mcclellan"><surname full="yes">McClellan</surname></persName>, and, even if it were taken, nothing but the brick and mortal it is built of would be lost to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" />If it did, why <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> should it labor with all its power to render the <rs>South</rs> not worth having? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" /> It is not merely the ruin of towns and public buildings, and the desolation of fields, or the slaughter of our people, which show the inconsistency of the present destructive policy of the <rs>Lincoln</rs> dynasty with the anticipation of conquering the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />Towns may be rebuilt, desolated fields will grow green again, a population grievously thinned by war may be again replenished; but when the only system of labor by which towns can be restored, fields cultivated, and a population supported, is to be torn up by the roots, we may fairly conclude that the architects of such destruction are aiming to ruin rather than to rule.--That the <rs>Cotton States</rs> can ever be cultivated except by slave labor, is a lunacy which we are not warranted in attributing even to the <rs>Washington Cabinet</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />If they really expect to emancipate the slaves and still make the country profitable, which is the only condition on which the <rs>Yankees</rs> desire a country, they are the most hopeless madmen the world has ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40" />If the <rs>South</rs> is to be subjugated, she could not inflict upon her conqueror a more fatal stab than that he is preparing for his own bosom.--Burning the cotton that it may not fall into his hands is nothing to his own plan of destroying the labor by which the cotton is raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41" />Emancipate the slaves and the cotton-growing States become as profitless to the commerce and manufacturers of the world as <placeName reg="Jamaica, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015863" authname="tgn,7015863">Jamaica</placeName> and <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388" authname="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261" /> The inalienable and invaluable right of the people to assemble together and consult for the common good, together with its necessary concomitants — the freedom of speech and the press — are secured to you, my countrymen, by the most sacred compacts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262" />They shall never find a disturber in me. Yet you will remember that the same instruments which guarantee these great rights also limit you to the exercise of them within the bounds of law, and impose upon me the solemn duty of seeing that these bounds be not transgressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263" />The Constitution of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and all laws passed in pursuance thereof, are the supreme law of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264" />Resistance to them by combination is <hi rend="italics">treason,</hi> and, without combination, is a high crime against the laws of your country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265" />Let no <num value="1">one</num> be deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266" />So long as these laws remain upon the statute book they shall be executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267" />Surely, my countrymen, you would not seek to cure the evils of <num value="1">one</num> revolution by plunging the country into another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268" />You will not knowingly, to the present desolating war with the common enemy, add the horrors of internal strife and entire subversion of law and civil authority!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269" />You must not forget the enviable character which you have always maintained as a sober, conservative, and law-abiding people; nor would I have you to forget the plain, easy, and <hi rend="italics">constitutional</hi> method of redressing your grievances.

There is no grievance to redress, and no proposition to be made, but can be most beneficially effected in the way our fathers marked out by the ballot-box and the other constitutionally appointed means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272" />In times of great public sensibility like the present, any departure from this legal channel is revolutionary and dangerous, and tends to the division and destruction of our people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273" /> It is my great desire, and, I hope, that of all good citizens, that our people should remain united, befall us what may. Should we triumph in the great struggle for independence let no feelings of revenge, no bitterness mar the rejoicing of that glorious day. Should we fall, and come short of that great object for which we have struggled so long and bled co-freely, let not <num value="1">one</num> strifes and domestic lends add to the bitterness of defeat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274" /> Attempts suddenly to change the existing order of things would only result in bloodshed and ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275" />I therefore implore you, my countrymen, of all shades, of political opinion, to abstain from assembling together for the purpose of denouncing each other, whether at home or in the army, and to avoid socking any remedy for the evils of the times by other than legal means and through the properly constituted authorities.
