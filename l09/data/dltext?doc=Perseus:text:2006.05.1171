<milestone unit="sentence" n="256" />It is done to make the <rs>Yankee</rs> nation forget the innumerable bloody defeats its armies have sustained since last <dateStruct value="-05-" full="yes" authname="--05"><month reg="05" full="yes">May</month></dateStruct>--the <num value="150000">one hundred and fifty thousand</num> that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0" authname="grant"><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName> has led to slaughter or captivity in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> — the <num value="70">seventy</num> or <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num> that have been slain, wounded, or taken under <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0" authname="sherman"><surname full="yes">Sherman</surname></persName> — the entire expulsion of their troops from <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826" authname="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>--the disgraceful defeat of <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0" authname="banks"><surname full="yes">Banks</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256" authname="tgn,7007256"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Louisiana</placeName> and the almost entire loss of that State--the recovery of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172" authname="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> almost entirely by the <rs>Confederates</rs>--the inauguration of a furious war in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255" authname="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>--the defeat in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240" authname="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>--making altogether a series of disasters such as rarely ever befell a modern army in so short a space of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257" />And it has succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258" />The little success at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331" authname="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, swelled and exaggerated by the most infamously mendacious press that the world ever beheld, into a mighty achievement, commanding the most momentous results, has already made the <rs>Yankee</rs> nation forget its defeats and humiliations — has run them mad with exultation, and has roused once more the cry for blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259" />Incapable of being taught by experience, the people of Yankeedom — as we knew they would — trust implicitly to their lying oracles, as though they had never deceived them before, when they tell them for the <num value="50" type="ordinal">fiftieth</num> time that the rebellion is on its last legs, and that they need only an expenditure of a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> more lives to crush it forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260" />And all this in the interest of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> and of the party which is to profit by his election; or, which is the same thing, by the continuance of this war. They play for a high stake, and their "dice are human bones." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261" /> Such form a portion of the devices by which the <rs>Yankee</rs> nation is to be seduced into a continual support of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00165" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> and the war; but these are not all. The interesting people whom it is proposed to amuse in this manner, love war and glory; but it is always with a proviso that they come in for a share of the glory only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262" />They do not greatly desire to take any of the hard knocks that precede the glory and are necessary to its acquisition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263" />They have a peculiar horror of the draft, and there is great danger that the enforcement of it may turn to the disadvantage of the war candidate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264" />It is unfortunate, certainly, for the prospects of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00166" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> that it should come on just at this particular moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265" />Especially is the great <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567" authname="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName>, which has already shown symptoms of a determination to resist, a subject of intense <sic>anxieity</sic> to the war candidate and his party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266" />Accordingly, a device, so transparent that it could deceive no other people on the face of the earth, has been adopted to keep quiet the multitude of <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567" authname="tgn,7007567">Gotham</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267" />They are told that there will be no draft amongst them — that their prodigious patriotism has already gone far ahead of the requisitions of the <rs>Government</rs> — that they will be credited with a number of men fully equal to the whole number that they will be assessed with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268" />Other portions of the country are dangerous likewise, for they have votes, and may give them against <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> if he presses the draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269" />This head of the <name>Cerberus</name> must also be gratified with a sop, and <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0" authname="stanton"><surname full="yes">Stanton</surname></persName> throws it to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270" />He tells them there will be no draft anywhere for <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure>, and so they may go about their business for the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271" />Indeed, he thinks if they will only send <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0" authname="grant"><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName> <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> more men, he is sure that not more than <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> will be required, and <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of these will only be required to keep open roads and rivers, restore commerce, and settle other matters appertaining to conquest, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0" authname="grant"><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName> having by this time done all the fighting that is to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272" />Last of all, to lull the whole nation to rest, <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0" authname="seward"><surname full="yes">Seward</surname></persName> tells them that there will be no draft at all — that no draft is necessary — that volunteers enough have been found to fill up the ranks to the required extent — that is, to the extent of <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num>!!! We hope to be excused for marking this passage with <num value="3">three</num> notes of admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273" />It is so wonderful, that nothing short of <num value="3">three</num> could properly express our amazement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274" /> These proceedings indicate <num value="1">one</num> thing, at least, very clearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275" />It is that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> and his followers have a mortal fear of this draft, and that they dare not at this time attempt to enforce it. Yet that it will be enforced, at the point of the bayonet if necessary, is as clear as that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276" />Let <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName> be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> assured of success, and then we shall see how speedily he will dispose of all objections, and what disposition he will make of those who urge them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277" />How completely soever he may succeed in blinding his own people to his intentions, it does not become the people of these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to be equally blind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278" />That the draft will be executed, and that completely and thoroughly, we repeat we hold to be absolutely certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279" />That <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0" authname="grant"><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName> will be heavily reinforced, although for the present he may not be able to obtain the full <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> that he calls for, we likewise consider a certainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280" />We state our belief with no view of depressing the spirits of our people, which, however cast down for the moment, have always risen to the full height of every emergency whenever it has been presented to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281" />We are fully able to meet and to master all the circumstances of the crisis which is about to present itself to us, and our object is to prepare our people for doing so. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
