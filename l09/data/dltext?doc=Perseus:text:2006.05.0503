<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />This is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that our brave little Frenchman has had occasion to retire before the enemy, and the success which attended the movement has stamped him at once as the muster General of the war.--With an enemy immediately in front of him, shelling his men even while they were in the act of retiring, with sick to move <unclear /> of provisions to be provided with a places of safety, and all the multifarious operations of an army to be performed, he succeeded even beyond his own expectations in placing himself fairly beyond the reach of the foe before they were aware of the intended evacuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />I have not heard that a men was lost, or a dollar's worth of nobles property destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20" />The <unclear />, however, have not yet transpired, and it may be that before the army reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21" />Its resting place, the <name>Roer</name> guard were slightly engaged with the <rs>Federal</rs> skirmishers. --This supposition is induced by several returns in town this morning, to the effect that a portion of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Price,Sterling,,," authname="price,sterling"><surname full="yes">Price</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> had a fight after the main body of the army had moved out. I said there was no loss of public property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" /><num value="4">Four</num> trains of cars were destroyed, and <num value="6">six</num> engines; but this was done by the railroad officials, under a misapprehension of instructions when the trains were left between <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi" authname="tgn,7017649">Corinth</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pocahontas, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057263" authname="tgn,2057263">Pocahontas</placeName>, and the <num value="3">three</num> badges being burned which connected these places, nothing could be done but destroy the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23" />The loss, however, is not great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />We already have more rolling stock than we can use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" />The causes which led to the evacuation are such as will commend themselves to every fairly judging mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />powerless.--Had he advanced upon the entrenchments of the enemy, already within a mile — indeed, so near that shell were thrown into the heart of his camps — his success, if at all, should have been limited, and the loss of life would have been great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />The Federal could have fallen back foot by foot, contesting every inch of ground, and thus compelled our men to follow, clambering over <hi rend="italics">abattis</hi> and among their enfilading ambuscades, while death thinned our ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29" />A complete rout, such as was necessary to ensure complete victory, was, therefore, at least, doubtful, if not impossible, and the result of a failure would have been disastrous in the extreme. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" />The picture is reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />We have fallen back out of the woods into open fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />where a battle when fought may be comprehended at a glance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199" /> We think it likely that the <hi rend="italics">Herald's</hi> correspondent tells the truth about this matter, as there seems to be no motive for a lie, and, indeed, that such is the general sentiment of the <rs>Northern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208" />But, then, on the other hand, if civilization consists in gas, electricity, steam, and commerce, no <num value="1">one</num> can deny that they are the most civilized of American people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209" /> If we look abroad upon the face of the <rs>Yankee</rs> country, what do we see?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210" />A widespread territory, in which the cultivation of the soil and rural avocations are held in little respect, and city life is the great attraction of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211" />The cities are the great hives of all the energy, skill, talent, and rascality of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212" />Commerce and manufactures are the only employments by which they desire to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213" />The rural districts, stripped of every element of strength and influence, look to the cities for instruction in everything, and are humble copyists of their fashions and their vices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214" />These last are more easily transplanted, and have taken root widely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215" />The records of crime in the country portions of the <rs>North</rs> show that they are not much behind the cities in every species of iniquity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216" />If being civilized means reading, writing, somewhat indifferent spelling, and a knowledge of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="4">four</num> rules of arithmetic, then the majority of the <rs>Northern</rs> rural population deserve to be so considered, though the manner in which they talk through their noses and murder the <rs>King</rs>'s English, do not establish any very strong claims to precedence on that score.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217" />If being civilized, means to be <q direct="unspecified">"cute,"</q> <q direct="unspecified">"smart,"</q> and to cheat your neighbor in a trade, they were undoubtedly the most civilized people on the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220" />New York, the <rs type="place">Empire City</rs>, may be taken as a mir specimen of them all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224" />Looking at its outside, <num value="1">one</num> is dazzled by its whiteness; but within there is the smell and corruption of the charnel house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225" />It has splendid houses, whose proprietors never dine at home, but leave their wives and children to make their dinner off a cup of tea and a cold round.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226" />It is full of gorgeous churches, where the minister has a grand levee on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the week, in which he endeavors to entertain his visitors to the best of his ability, whilst the sexton is so particular as to the appearance of the guests who are admitted that, if <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota" authname="tgn,7013947">St. Paul</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2055458" n="1.000 3" reg="saint peter, nicollet, minnesota" authname="tgn,2055458">St. Peter</placeName> were to make their appearance at the door in the same apparel in which they evangelized the world, he would take them out by the coat collar and hand them over for safe-keeping to the nearest policeman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228" />They have Christian Associations, made up of very nice people — i. e., according to <persName n="Swift,,Dean,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="default:Swift,Dean,,," authname="swift,dean"><foreName full="yes">Dean</foreName> <surname full="yes">Swift</surname></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">"people of very nasty ideas"</q>--young men who, up to the period of the present war, were so handsomely dressed that they looked the very pinks of <q direct="unspecified">"civilization,"</q> and smiled so meekly that they might have passed for pocket editions of the <rs>Apostle St. John</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229" />They looked, these fine fellows, as if butter would scarcely melt in their mouths, and that nothing would give them greater pleasure than to be eaten up by lions or martyred into steaks for the good of manking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230" />They were so particular in their morals that they considered it a sin to laugh audibly, and so compassionate to human suffering that they regarded the capital punishment of a criminal as little better than the crime for which he suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231" />They had immense union prayer- meetings, not <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, at which they gave the most astounding evidences not only of civilization, but of such supernatural religious graces, as made a good many people believe that the <sic>millenium</sic> was at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232" />And now, what has become of all this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233" />Why, these very associations and prayer-meetings, which might have made us believe that New York was far ahead of the <rs type="place">Celestial City</rs> itself in godliness and purity, became, with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blast of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0" authname="lincoln"><surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>'s war trumpet, transformed into ravenous wolves, not a vestige of the sheep or lamb left; not <num value="1">one</num> evangelical fleece, not a single pious bleat; but the whole pack howling together in a furious concert for Southern blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234" /> When the <rs>Yankee</rs> officers call all this civilization, and propose to spread it among us outside barbarians by the process of colonization, they must not be surprised if we resist them to the death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235" />We may not have much gas, electricity, steam, commerce, but neither have we armies of paupers, strumpets, robbers, and murderers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243" />They have discovered long since that they cannot do it by telling the truth, and they therefore abandon the truth entirely as an obsolete idea, or a broken weapon, which it is no longer possible to use with effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248" />The inventive faculty is strong in them all, but the inventive power is totally wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249" />If a great invention is brought to light in the mechanical world, they steal it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250" />In fact, no Yankee ever invented anything but a lie. There they are without rivals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251" />It seems to be a national talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252" />Few of them are without it, and the few that have it not envy the larger number who possess it, as despair only can envy superior merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253" />It is so completely a national characteristic that no man in Yankeedom sees any harm in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254" />It is probable, therefore, that the <rs>Southern</rs> prints are dealing too harshly with <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0" authname="mcclellan"><surname full="yes">McClellan</surname></persName> for his lying bulletins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255" />It would be as fair to blame the <name>African</name> for being black, or the serpent for not walking on all-fours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256" />He lies because it is his nature to lie; he does not speak truth, because the truth is not in him. He sees no harm in lying, because he was educated among people who think a clever lie preferable at all times to a troublesome truth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257" /> And yet, in spite of the natural propensity of Yankeedom to lie, and although they could scarcely avoid it if they were so disposed, the frequency and the enormous character of their lies at this particular juncture argues well for our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258" />They would undoubtedly tell the truth, let the effort be as painful as it might, could the truth by any means be of service to their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259" />They are always capable of sacrificing feeling to interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260" />When, therefore, we find a General, just before a battle, reading to his troops a dispatch from <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0" authname="mcclellan"><surname full="yes">McClellan</surname></persName> announcing the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, we may feel assured that his troops have no stomach for the work they are called on to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261" />In a word, this system of lying betokens a degree of desperation but thinly disguised under the jubilant exultation in which <persName n="Doodle,,Yankee,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="default:Doodle,Yankee,,," authname="doodle,yankee"><foreName full="yes">Yankee</foreName> <surname full="yes">Doodle</surname></persName> is wont to indulge upon the slightest manifestation of a small success. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264" />Lie he will, of course, and lie monstrously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265" />But what sort of a lie will it be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266" />How can he disguise the true state of the case, or account for the marvel?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268" />Will not the world arrive at the conclusion that Yankee Napoleons are like <name>Yankee</name> nutmegs, arrant cheats, and nothing else? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269" /> We are very much afraid the <rs>Yankee Government</rs> will get disgusted with <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0" authname="mcclellan"><surname full="yes">McClellan</surname></persName>'s loud bragging and poor performance, and turn him adrift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270" />We should deprecate his dismissal as a serious misfortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271" />Perhaps they would send some man — if it be possible to find such in Yankeedom — who would lie less and do more.
