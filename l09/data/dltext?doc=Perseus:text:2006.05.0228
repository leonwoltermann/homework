<milestone unit="sentence" n="616" />To his consummate judgment in choosing our ground, we are indebted for our almost miraculous escape from utter destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617" />We were placed on the slope of a hill, facing to the <rs>West</rs>, with a slight depression or ravine, running almost parallel with the base of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618" />We came <q direct="unspecified"> "into battery"</q> and unlimbered in this depression, being thus sheltered by a swell in the ground to our front <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619" />Our position commanded a beautiful open farm which rose gently from the valley in front of us, back to the woods about <measure n="1500yards" type="distance">1,500 yards distant</measure>. In the edge of these woods a heavy column of the enemy was marching to the southward, while we were descending the hill to our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620" />At the moment we wheeled into line, I observed <num value="1">one</num> of their batteries of <num value="6">six</num> guns do the same thing, and they unlimbered simultaneously with us. We immediately loaded with special ease shot, with the fuse cut for <measure n="1500yards" type="distance">1,500 yards</measure>. <persName n="Bee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00474" reg="nearbymention:Bee,William,C.,," authname="bee,william,c."><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Bee</surname></persName> ordered me not to fire till they opened on me, as he had sent the <orgName type="regiment" key="4ALRegiment">Fourth Alabama Regiment</orgName>, <persName n="Jones,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00475" reg="nearbymention:Jones,W.,T.,," authname="jones,w.,t."><roleName n="Colonel" full="yes">Colonel</roleName> <surname full="yes">Jones</surname></persName>, across the valley to our right to occupy a piece of woods about <measure n="500yards" type="distance">500 yards</measure> nearer the enemy, and he, wished this Regiment, together with <num value="1">one</num> <num value="6">6</num>-pounder they had along with them, to get fairly in position before we fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621" />He had hardly uttered the order, however, when the enemy's <orgName type="battery" n="battery 6">battery--six</orgName> long rifle <num value="10">10</num>-pounder <name type="weapon">Parrott guns</name>, afterwards captured by our troops — within <measure n="150yards" type="distance">150 yards</measure> of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> position, opened on us with elongated cylindrical shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622" />They passed a few feet over our heads, and very near the <rs>General</rs> and his Staff in our rear, and exploded near the top of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623" />We instantly returned the compliment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625" />This was the last time my gallant, heroic General ever spoke to me. Seeing us fairly engaged, he rode off to take charge of his regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626" />The firing of both batteries now became very rapid — they at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> over shot us and burst their shells in our rear, but at every round improved their aim and shortened their fuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627" />In about <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> we received our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628" />A shell passed between <num value="2">two</num> of our guns and exploded amongst the caissons, mangling the arm of <persName n="Points,Private,J.,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00477" reg="default:Points,J.,J.,," authname="points,j.,j."><roleName n="Private" full="yes">private</roleName> <foreName full="yes">J.</foreName> <foreName full="yes">J.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Points</surname></persName> with a fragment in a most shocking manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629" />I ordered him to be carried off the field to the surgeon at once.--He was scarcely gone when another shell exploded at the same place and killed a horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630" />About this time the enemy began to fire too low, striking the knoll in our front, from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="20">twenty</num> steps, from which the ricochet was sufficient to carry the projectiles over us; they discovered this, and again began to fire over us. After we had been engaged for perhaps <num value="0.5">a half</num> hour, the enemy brought another battery of <num value="4">four</num> guns into position about <measure n="400yards" type="distance">400 yards</measure> south of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and a little nearer to us, and commenced a very brisk fire upon us. A shell from this last battery soon plunged into our midst, instantly killing a horse and nearly cutting off the leg of <persName n="Siders,Private,W.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00478" reg="default:Siders,W.,A.,," authname="siders,w.,a."><roleName n="Private" full="yes">private</roleName> <foreName full="yes">W.</foreName> <foreName full="yes">A.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Siders</surname></persName>, just below the knee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631" />He was immediately taken to the surgeon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632" />A few minutes afterwards another shell did its work by wounding <persName n="Garber,Lieutenant-2,A.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00479" reg="default:Garber,A.,W.,," authname="garber,a.,w."><roleName n="Lieutenant-2" full="yes">2nd Lieut.</roleName> <foreName full="yes">A.</foreName> <foreName full="yes">W.</foreName> <surname full="yes">Garber</surname></persName> so severely in the wrist that I ordered him off the field for surgical aid. We now had <num value="10">ten</num> guns at work upon us, with no artillery to aid us for more than an hour, except, I believe, <num value="3">three</num> rounds fired by the gun with the <orgName type="mil" key="ALRegiment">Alabama Regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633" />It ceased its fire, I have heard, because the horses ran off with the limber and left the gun without ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634" />During this time the enemy's infantry was assembling behind, between and to the right (our left) of their batteries in immense numbers, but beyond our reach, as we could only see their bayonets over the top of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635" /><num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times they ventured in sight, when the <name>Alabamians</name> turned them back on their left by a well directed fire, and we gave them a few shot and shells on their right with the same result, as they invariably dropped back over the hill when we fired at them, as almost every shot made a gap in their ranks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636" /> After we had been engaged for, I suppose, nearly <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, a detachment of some other battery, (the <rs>New Orleans Washington Battalion</rs>, I believe,) of <num value="2">two</num> guns, formed upon our right and commenced a well directed fire, much to our aid and relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637" />My men by this time were so overcome with the intense heat and excessive labor, that half of them fell upon the ground completely exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638" />The guns were so hot that it was dangerous to lead them--<num value="1">one</num> was temporarily spiked by the priming wire hanging in it, the vent having become foul.--My teams were cut to places, <num value="5">five</num> of the horses were killed out of one single place, and other teams partially destroyed, so that, alone, we could not much longer have replied to the enemy's batteries as briskly as was necessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639" /> We were now serving the guns with diminished numbers--<persName n="Harman,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00480" reg="mostcommon:Harman,nomatch:0" authname="harman"><roleName n="Lieutenant" full="yes">Lieuts.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Harman</surname></persName> and <persName n="Imboden,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00481" reg="nearbymention:Imboden,John,D.,," authname="imboden,john,d."><roleName n="Lieutenant" full="yes" /><surname full="yes">Imboden</surname></persName> working at them as privates, to relieve the privates; the latter had the handspike in his hand directing his piece, when <num value="1">one</num> of its rings was shot off of the mail by a piece of a shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640" />After our friends on the right commenced firing, the enemy advanced <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> battery of <num value="4">four</num> pieces down the hill, directly in front of </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3" /> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641" /> and about <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards distant</measure> from us, upon which we opened fire immediately and crippled <num value="1">one</num> of their guns by cutting off its trail, compelling them to dismount and send the piece away without its carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642" />While this last battery was forming in our front, a vast column of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of infantry marched down in close order, about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> go its right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643" />I did not then know where the several regiments of our brigade were posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644" />We heard firing upon our right and left, but too far off to pretest us from a sudden charge, as we were in the middle of an open field, and not a single <orgName n="Infantry Company" type="company">company of infantry</orgName> visible to us on the right, left or rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645" />At the moment the enemy's main column came down the hill, we observed the head of another column advancing down the valley from our left, and therefore concealed by a hill, and not over <num value="350">350</num> or <measure n="400yards" type="distance">400 yards distant</measure>. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I took them for friends, and ordered the men not to fire on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646" />To ascertain certainly who they were, I sprang upon my horse and galloped to the top of the hill to our left, when I had a nearer and better view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647" />There were <num value="2">two</num> regiments of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648" />They halted about <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> in front of their own battery on the hill-side, wheeled into line with their backs towards us, and fired a volley, apparently at their battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649" />This deceived me, and I shouted to my men to fire upon the battery, that these were friends, who would charge and take it in a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650" />Fortunately, my order was not heard or not obeyed by all the gunners, for some of them commenced firing into this line, which brought them to the right- about, and they commenced advancing towards us, when their uniform disclosed fully their character.
