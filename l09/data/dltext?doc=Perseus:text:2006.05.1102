<milestone unit="sentence" n="11" />The city was somewhat excited yesterday morning by a report that a general engagement was going on in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404" authname="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and the sound of distant cannon, rapidly discharged, being distinctly heard in elevated positions, the report was generally believed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12" />As the day advanced, however, the press dispatches announced that nothing unusual was in progress, and our community became again quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13" />The general belief now is that if a great battle takes place shortly it will be brought on by our troops making the attack; for it seems to be <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,," authname="grant,gen"><surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName>'s policy to <unclear /> hard fighting for the present, while he resorts to the expedient of making <unclear /> upon our railroads, and thus embarrassing transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14" />All the contests that have thus far taken place have proved that his troops are no match for the <rs>Confederates</rs> in valor, and their conduct shows that they are tired of "butting against the rebel <unclear />" They are content to dig dirt, in employment which suits them better than fighting, and the <rs>Yankee</rs> lines in <persName><roleName n="Prince" full="yes">Prince</roleName> <foreName full="yes">George</foreName></persName> will doubtless be protected by formidable fortifications, as they were in <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147" authname="tgn,2112147">Hanover</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16" />An attack was made upon them in <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, and after a sharp fight they were driven off, and some <num value="500">five hundred</num> of the blue rascals captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />This handsome exploit <unclear>re </unclear> much credit upon the troops engaged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19" />The Yankee loss in the engagement of <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> is estimated by competent, judges at something over <num value="4000">four thousand</num> in killed, wounded and prisoners; while our own, at the outside, did not exceed <num value="400">four hundred</num>, and some think <num value="300">three hundred</num> will cover the entire casualties. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22" />This of course was behaved to be greatly exaggerated, if not entirely romantic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24" />They proved to be cavalry, and fled at our approach, having destroyed about <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> of the track, which will be repaired to day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25" /> <rs type="role">Gen.</rs> M., however, did not stop here, but pushed forward, and about nightfall succeeded in overtaking a part of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 6">sixth corps</orgName>, and captured about <measure n="480" type="prisoners">four hundred and eighty prisoners</measure>, including <num value="20">twenty</num> commissioned officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26" />Our loss was quite small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27" />The affair was only a brilliant surprise, and our captures were made after a sharp but decisive skirmish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28" />The enemy being surprised, their chief loss was in prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31" /> Last night about <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> there was heavy firing, but it amounted to little or nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32" />A woman was killed by a shell thrown in the city on yesterday evening.--Very few shells have been thrown into the city to-day. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" /> This morning about sunrise our batteries on the <rs>Chesterfield</rs> side of the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, opened a furious cannonade on the enemy's lines near <orgName type="battery" n="battery 5">battery No. 5</orgName>, on the <placeName key="tgn,2240477" n="1.000 1473" reg="city point, virginia, virginia" authname="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" />They charged the enemy's skirmishers and drove them back, capturing some <num value="30">thirty</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />Their line of battle, however, was too strong for us, and so our troops had to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167" /> Well, what could then only be thus obscurely foreshadowed, is to-day a realized fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168" />Indeed, I may now go further and state that from the very start the transfer of the army to the southside of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> has formed an integral part of <persName n="Grant,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="default:Grant,Gen,,," authname="grant,gen"><foreName full="yes">Gen</foreName> <surname full="yes">Grant</surname></persName>'s plan of campaign, and <unclear> </unclear> the battle of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> was still in progress, the whole question of pontooning the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> was elaborately discussed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169" /> And now, recognizing the relations which his action holds to the general plan of operations — now that it stands defined as the pivotal point of the whole campaign — would it be too much for me to ask those presses that abused me for having so recognized it a fortnight ago, to take back that abuse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170" /> The battle of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> was an experiment made for a specific purpose — to test the possibility of an assault on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> from the northern side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171" />It was an experiment perfectly proper to be made, and it was satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172" />It convinced every reflecting mind that nothing was to be gained in that direction. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176" /> Now begins a new act in the grand was drama.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177" />We shall operate on new and unattempted lines, looking to new and hitherto unattainable results, and we think there are few military men who do not now feel that the present position of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> gives us reason to indulge brighter hopes of ultimate success than has been possible any time since the war began. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179" />Of the <num value="3">three</num> cardinal maxims of strategy, the most important of all prescribes "to operate on the enemy's communications without endangering your own."

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184" />All that we can reckon as gained, therefore, is the loss of life inflicted on the enemy, and of having reached a point thus near the objective, but no brilliant military results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257" />Instead of appearing reluctant to do his part, he evinced a readiness and even a desire to aid in the defence of the city, and, disclosing his knowledge of artillery practice and gunnery, was made a <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-2">Second Lieutenant</rs> in an artillery militia company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258" />This led to his being sent out to the fortifications to assist in instructing his company in leading aiming, and firing heavy guns, and afforded him an opportunity of examining the defensive works as well as of escape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259" /> My reference to these works will, therefore, be founded on his knowledge, combined with my own. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263" />The Union army then outnumbered the rebel host by <num value="1">one</num>- <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, and I believe <num value="0.5">one half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276" />These experiments were so satisfactory that the rebel Government determined to employ the gun cotton for artillery fire, and ordered a large number of guns and howitzers manufactured in which it will be used to the exclusion of ordinary powder.
