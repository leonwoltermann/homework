<milestone unit="sentence" n="33" />The rest took all the valuables they could carry away, packed the rest in boxes, locked the doors, and fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34" />It was the most melancholy picture I had ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35" />Our soldiers had come over, broken open the houses, rifled the boxes, carried off tables, chairs, sofas, and whatever else they could make useful, and wantonly destroyed what they could not take away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36" />Passing through the deserted street, I saw through an open door a woman sweeping a little shop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37" />She said she had left town with the rest, but thought she would come back to look after the few things she had left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38" />They had all disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39" />The house had been broken open and everything in it carried away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43" />They broke open the boxes, threw the contents out into the street, and completely stripped the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44" />At another house, after taking away what they wanted, they emptied jars of sweet-meats which they poured into the river — At the house of <persName n="Cary,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Cary,nomatch:0" authname="cary"><roleName n="Mrs." full="yes">a Mrs.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Cary</surname></persName>, they smashed to pieces all the <rs n="glass ware" type="product">glass ware</rs> they could find, much of which was very valuable.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69" /> At last we have got a Government was the delighted exclamation of a Northern journalist, when the <rs>Washington Cabinet</rs>, having ascertained the will of its many-headed master, began to exchange its attitude of <unclear>le</unclear> wavering for <num value="1">one</num> of warlike preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70" />The remark aptly expresses the ineffective sympathy of ultra-democracy with high handed displays of power, and it is not, perhaps, without a sinister significance as regards the ulterior results of the struggle into which the model Republic has plunged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71" />According to present appearance, there is every probability that, if the war lasts any length of time, the <rs>American</rs> people may find, before it is over, that they really have got a Government in a sense little dreamed of by the founders of their constitutional liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72" />A vigorous Executive, unembarrassed by over-nice notions of legality, seems to be the present ideal of Transatlantic aspirations; end it in an ideal which, under favorable circumstances, is wonderfully apt to realise itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73" />Laws are proverbially silent in the midst of arms; and a civil war, in which the <rs>Central Executive</rs> constitutes itself the organ of the fiercest passions of a democracy, is admirably calumniated to generate what <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe," authname="tgn,1000003">European</placeName> politicians call <q direct="unspecified">"strong government."</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76" />In what respect the existing Washington Government differs from a military dictatorship it might take some time to explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77" />We see the <rs>President</rs> assuming and actively exercising powers which might almost content the <rs>Executive</rs> of the most absolute <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe," authname="tgn,1000003">European</placeName> monarchy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84" /><num value="2">Two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> ago, the <rs>President</rs> ordered a razzia to be made, at a given day and hour, on the telegraph offices in all the principal towns of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, on the chance of finding evidence against <q direct="unspecified">"traitors"</q> His officers took forcible possession of the manuscript originals of all telegrams sent to the <rs>South</rs>, during the preceding <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>, and carried them off for inspection by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85" />This arbitrary and violent, but unquestionably smart, proceeding — which may perhaps afford a useful hint to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe," authname="tgn,1000003">European</placeName> despotisms — appears to have been decidedly popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86" />American editors recorded it with undisguised complacency, and evidently admired the sagacity with which the little <hi rend="italics">coup d'etat</hi> was planned, and the dexterity with which it was executed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87" /> The Times' New York correspondent speaks of it with much satisfaction as <q direct="unspecified">"a bold stroke,"</q> and is pleased to think that <q direct="unspecified">"the possession of such a mass of material gives the <rs>Government</rs> a guarantee for the <unclear>qute</unclear> behavior of suspected and disaffected persons."</q> It is unnecessary to remark that the possession of the bodies of suspected and disaffected persons would furnish a still better guarantee for their quiet behavior; and, in fact, as we shall presently see, this obvious reflection has already suggested itself to some of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,," authname="lincoln,abraham"><roleName n="President" full="yes">President</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Generals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88" />Judging from the general approbation which has attended the raid on the telegraphic offices there can be little doubt that Northern opinion would be equally ready to sanction the <q direct="unspecified">"administrative seizure"</q> of the types and presses of an obnoxious Secessionist newspaper — if, at least, it were possible that such a journal could exist with in reach of a New York mob. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89" /> The last mall brings us word of a still bolder stroke of military usurpation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90" />The collision between <persName n="Cadwallader,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Cadwallader,nomatch:0" authname="cadwallader"><roleName n="General" full="yes">General</roleName> <surname full="yes">Cadwallader</surname></persName> and <persName n="Taney,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Taney,nomatch:0" authname="taney"><roleName n="Chief-Justice" full="yes">Chief Justice</roleName> <surname full="yes">Taney</surname></persName> is somewhat absurdly called in the newspapers <q direct="unspecified">"a conflict of law."</q> but it was, in truth, simply a conflict between law and illegal violence, in which law suffered a total defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91" />It just amounts to this — that the commander of the <rs>Northern</rs> troops now in occupation of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352" authname="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> has taken it upon him, without so much as the preliminary formality of a proclamation of martial law, to arrest and imprison at his discretion civilians accused or suspected of political offences, and that the authority of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> is summarily set asides by order of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,," authname="lincoln,abraham"><roleName n="President" full="yes">President</roleName> <surname full="yes">Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92" />Without any sanction from Congress, and by the simple flat of he <rs type="role2">President</rs> and his General the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> is treated as so much waste paper — and this, too, in a State which still adheres to the <rs>Union</rs>, and in which the civil authorities have never been superseded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201" />The highest test of the popularity of a great movement in the extent to which it commands popular contributions of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202" />It is now given out that the subscriptions of cotton to the <rs>Confederate</rs> loan bids fair to reach the enormous amount of <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of bales, worth a <num value="150000000">hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203" />Liberality like this is really unprecedented in the history of war and finance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204" />It denotes a popular sympathy with the efforts of the <rs>Government</rs> to which no political struggle ever engaged in, furnishes a parallel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205" /> There are features belonging to these contributions which no other public loans have ever possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206" />It is made, in the first place, without material privations to the planters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207" />The planter who is in debt can employ the bonds of Government which he receives for his cotton, in discharge of his indebtedness, and the subscription costs him nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208" />The planter who is not in debt simply invests in Confederate bonds what he otherwise would have laid out in the purchase of more lands and negroes; and the possession of an <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> fund surely relieves his liberality to the <rs>Government</rs> of the disadvantage of materially curtailing his income.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209" />The planter who is neither in debt nor disposed to invest his-earnings in more land and additional negroes, is relieved by the subscription of the perplexity of seeking out subjects of investment, which might prove precarious and unremunerative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210" />This class of people were too much in the habit of spending their summers in the <rs>Northern</rs> cities and watering places, and of wasting the larger portion of their incomes among Northern hotels and shop-keepers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211" />When these objects of expenditure failed to absorb their whole revenues, they were generally persuaded by acute brokers and bubble-blowers in <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> to lay out their surplus cash in stocks of various fancy schemes as the <rs>North</rs>, which usually promise for a time large incomes, and generally wind up suddenly with terrible and destructive explosion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212" /> It is very clear that the planter is better off with Confederate bonds in his pocket, representing the cost of his Northern trip and of his speculations in <name>Yankee</name> stocks, than he would have been if he had indulged again his roving habits and made new adventures in <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> schemes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213" /> In the next place, the cost of the war to the <rs>South</rs> is, in this manner, very nearly saved, and the advantage is gained, that the money wasted at the <rs>North</rs> in pampering <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> insolence is now expended at the <rs>South</rs> in taking the starch out of that conceited race of upstarts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214" />The money contributed by these planters is retained in the <rs>South</rs> and paid to her own industrial classes for war supplies; whereas, under the old system, it would have gone off to the <rs>North</rs>, never to return, except, perhaps, in the shape of an army at some future day to deprive us of our independence.--By all the difference which money expended in a country makes in its general condition, as compared with the effect of expending the same amount of money out of the country, by all that difference is the <rs>South</rs> gainer by the war in regard to these contributions of her cotton planters to the <rs>Confederate</rs> loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215" />We predicate the proposition, of course, upon the assumption that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> will be able to sell the cotton crop for money, when it is ready for delivery next <rs type="season">fall</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216" /> Thus the contribution to this loan, while it does not injure the pecuniary condition of the subscribers to it, effects a positive saving of outlay to the country at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217" />There is this other advantage attending these cotton subscriptions to the <rs>Confederate</rs> loan: The bonds of the <rs>Government</rs> taken in lieu of cotton, are at once <hi rend="italics">placed</hi> in last hands, and are not thrown upon the market, according to the usual custom, to find their way to last purchasers, through <rs n="auction sales" type="product">auction sales</rs> and speculations at the <rs>Stock Boards</rs>, suffering all the <q direct="unspecified">"hammering"</q> and depreciation which that process invariably produces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218" />The usual process is to put Government bonds into the hands of bankers, who act as agents of Government in finding purchasers, and who often manipulate them with as much reference to their own profit as to the <rs>Government</rs>'s advantage, charging at the same time a considerable <hi rend="italics">shave</hi> as commission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219" /> The whole operation is at once saved by putting the bonds directly into the hands of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220" />All costs of commissions are thus saved, all loss from forced sales, all depreciation from speculating combinations.--The bonds go direct from the hands of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> to the final holders; and, in this instance, into the hands of a class of holders whose wealth and solid condition afford a guarantee that they will rarely get out upon the market, to experience the usual ups and downs of speculative stocks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221" /> In all our study of the history of stocks and finance, we have never known an instance of a public loan which has been put out under so many circumstances of public and private advantage and promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332" /> Never before have I been so fully impressed with the truth of the remark that "great armies are great evils." <orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName>, hitherto a stranger to them, is now, at their several points of assemblage, passing through an experience of their corrupting influence upon society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334" />How much our military organizations lack in discipline may be inferred from the fact that the streets of this city, from day to day and night after night, are filled with drunken, riotous, quarrelsome soldiers, who are permitted to crowd saloons and hotels, and to engage in brawls in the streets with entire impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335" />I confess I cannot understand it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336" /> Our soldiers in the city are fearfully demoralized, and citizens walk the streets with no positive immunity against assaults of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337" />It is impossible to go the length of the avenue without refusing several applications from drunken soldiers for money to buy a treat or a plug of tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338" />Fights are frequent and bloody, and in many instances pistols and bayonets are flourished by men maddened with liquor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339" />Nearly all the saloons of the city were closed yesterday by the proprietors, through fear of the soldiery, and at those which were open, fights were of constant occurrence.
