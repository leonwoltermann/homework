<head>The tax bill and the currency.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350" /> At last Congress has acted boldly and passed measures for revenue and for the reduction of the currency, which are destined to work a revolution in the finances of the country and the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351" />The <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> of the <name>Revolution</name> of '<num value="76">76</num> had no power to tax the people, and the great struggle of that day had to be conducted almost wholly upon the paper promises of the "so-styled" <orgName n="Continental Congress" type="congress">Continental Congress</orgName>.--Our own Government had the very great advantage over that of our ancestors, of the constitutional authority to impose a direct tax for the support of Government and the defence of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352" />Yet the <rs>Congress</rs> wanted the nerve to discharge its duty, and impose at once, in the incipiency of the war, a tax to sustain it. Demagogues and timidity — the fear to incur popular displeasure by the faithful discharge of a public duty — occasioned a postponement of that measure which sooner or later was known to be inevitable by every man, whether in or out of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353" />The motives for this delay were entertained under an entire misapprehension of the sentiments and opinions of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354" />They were as wise and as patriot as Congress, and greatly prefer red a prompt imposition of burthens they knew they had to bear, to the putting them off to be aggravated and increased by time, until they could be postponed no longer.--We now see that the necessity of the situation of public affairs has brought us to this point, and these accumulated burthens for the people being no longer avoidable, they are at last imposed — and we may say entirely and in all their magnitude. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355" /> So much the better!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356" />The people will be consoled by the reflection that the severe remedies now resorted to are absolutely indispensable to the desperate condition of the diseases of the public finances, which have produced the worst consequences not only to the <rs>Government</rs>, but to the people in all their occupations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357" />They will welcome the treatment that promises a cure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358" />To purity the currency — to elevate the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> — to bring down the standard of values from their inflated condition to that reasonable and rational stage which will dispense with the necessity of <num value="2">two</num> schedules of prices--<num value="1">one</num> for the people and <num value="1">one</num> for the <rs>Government</rs> — with all their evil consequences;--to do all this, or something approximating to it, the people will bear and suffer a great deal — nay, they have been ready at any time since the war to bear and to endure all that might be demanded by their country for these objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359" />They always knew that no national debt — war or other — could be paid in any way save by taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360" />Taxation or Repudiation is the inevitable alternative, and as they desire their Government to maintain its honor and its credit, they are out and out advocates for taxation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361" /> That the measures adopted by Congress are the best that could have been framed — or that they will operate with entire equality may not be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362" />But it is not the time now to criticise them or to oppose obstacles to their operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363" />The condition of affairs allows of no further postponement, and it cannot be complained that the remedies resorted to are too violent for the occasion in short, Southern men will cheerfully acquiesce in them as in patriotism they should, and, as in a just practical view of their personal and private interest, they will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364" />The heavy taxation and the reduction of the currency will not only compensate for the public burthens imposed by immediate benefits; but the people and the nation will be protected from that awful revulsion and financial ruin which was assuredly to fall upon them if no measures had been taken to check the paper issues of the <rs>Government</rs> and to increase its revenues for its own expenses and the public defence. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366" />There is always method in the madness of that peculiar people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367" />Hobbies they have of different kinds, but the hobbies all ride in <num value="1">one</num> direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368" />Whether it be prelacy, or papacy, or slavery, the end is always the same — confiscating somebody's goods and chattels, and putting the same in their own pious pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369" />No sooner had they overturned the <rs type="place">Church</rs> and State in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> than they divided their lands and revenues among themselves, and no sooner had they settled among the red men in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331" authname="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> than they confiscated all their possessions, which they called reclaiming the wilderness to civilization and the true Gospel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370" />All the negroes in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331" authname="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> that were not stolen from <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa" authname="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName> by Old England were stolen by <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203" authname="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and having been sold for high prices to the benighted Southerners, were stolen back again as fast as circumstances permitted, under the solemn conviction that slavery was a great crime, and must be put an end to as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371" />Carrying out the same philanthropic and pious purpose, they are now endeavoring to purge the <rs>South</rs> of all its inhabitants and their possessions, looking upon it as a Canaan, delivered over to themselves, who, in their own modest opinion, are the chosen people, whose bounden duty it is to own and slay all the <name>Amalekites</name>, Philistines, and other uncircumcised heathen, and enter in and possess the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372" />They conveniently forget that the territory of Canao belonged originally to the descendants of <persName><foreName full="yes">Abraham</foreName></persName>, that their patent to it was an express grant from the <rs>King</rs> of Heaven, and that the crimes of the <name>Canaanites</name> were of so horrible and unnatural a character that their extermination was as much an act of Divine Justice as the visitation of the flood upon the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373" />Among those crimes, we have never heard enumerated the sin of slavery, which, however, existed among the <name>Jews</name>, where it was established and regulated by Divine Law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374" /> But it is useless to discuss any question of right or justice with a people who never employ these terms except to cover some design of wrong and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375" />We know what they would be at and what they always have been after, without palavering about philanthropy, abolition, Canaanites, chosen people, and other stereotyped gibberish of Puritanical pick pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377" />It is a slight modification of the high waymen's demands--"your money and your life." It has the merit, a rare merit in Yankeedom, of dispensing with all hypocritical circumlocution, and shewing us the teeth and claws of the ravenous beast in their unadorned beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378" />It exposes the <rs>Puritan</rs> animal to us in his original and genuine shape, a creature that can whine disconsolately through his nose, and wall pathetically as a baby, but whose instincts are those <milestone unit="column" n="2" /> of the tiger and the hyena, and who is never so happy as when he has his prey on his back, and is gorging himself with blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379" /> Nothing is so gratifying to a true son of the <name>Pilgrims</name> as that kind of acquisition of other people's property known among the carnally minded as highway robbery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380" />It expands his soul and invigorates his mind; it makes him think better of himself and his fellow men, when, under the form of law, he can plunder some of his fellow creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381" />That is the whole object of this war, and when they have got our houses and farms, and turned us out upon the commons to starve and die, they will congratulate themselves upon it as a highly praiseworthy transaction, which they will celebrate by an annual thanksgiving, never doubting that they do <name n="God" type="God">God</name> service when they serve themselves. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
