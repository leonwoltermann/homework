<milestone unit="sentence" n="482" />There would be cause to distrust that Union with a superior division whose greatest motive is interest, and not respect for the people they desire to continue united with, and which has so unanimously avowed the doctrine and obligation of coercing seceding States, and who feel under such solemn conviction of conscientious duty to make the seceders pay taxes. --Anon, may we not apprehend the intervention of Emigrant Aid Societies to forestall Southern people in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> south of <num value="3630">36,30</num>, and a renewal of the bloody scenes of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254" authname="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and their agitating influences on the nation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485" /> The <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> is organized for <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>. That is a fixed fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486" />At its head stand public men — in the centre of whom is that <q direct="unspecified">"<hi rend="smallcaps">Bright Saladin of the <rs>South</rs>,</hi>"</q> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00391" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,," authname="davis,jefferson"><foreName full="yes">Jefferson</foreName> <surname full="yes">Davis</surname></persName></hi>--who are powerful in intellect, strong in resolution, and the man who expects child's play from them will be most woefully disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487" />That Confederacy embraces the most important staple-growing States in the late Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488" />The foreign trade with them is more to be sought for than that of all the balance of the <name>States</name> together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489" />Therefore, their independence will be promptly recognized by powerful foreign nations; and a new course of trade will commence with the <rs>American Atlantic</rs> seaboard and <persName n="Gulf,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00392" reg="mostcommon:Gulf,nomatch:0" authname="gulf"><surname full="yes">Gulf</surname></persName> utterly revolutionizing that heretofore existing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490" /> Will it be an easy matter to break up such a Government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491" />to abolish such alliances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492" />If the people who compose it are unwilling, what excuse will there be to attack them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493" />They declare a desire to settle all questions of property with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> upon the most just and equitable footing --they have forbidden the slave trade — they will allow the most unrestricted navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> — and evince a fairness and frankness which should elicit admiration rather than a revengeful spirit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494" /> There are reasons to suppose that they will not be willing to come back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495" />They have been the objects of obloquy and denunciation in the <rs>Congress</rs> and the whole <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496" />Their prominent men have been threatened with a talon's death, and the wrath and power of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> and of every Northern State have been held in readiness to burst upon them with all possible ferocity and ruthlessness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497" />How would a people so treated move amongst their denouncers, under a restoration of old relations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498" />Would a truce between them be candid, sincere and cordial?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499" />These are matters which the members of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> will no doubt fully canvass in their own minds. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500" /> <num value="4">IV</num>.--the <rs>Central Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501" /> The proposition of a Central Confederacy in the event of a failure to restore the <rs>Union</rs>, is an impracticable idea and can only result in tieing the border slave States to the <rs>North</rs> as members of an Union in which they will be utterly overpowered and so insignificant as never to be felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502" />Such a Confederacy, too, would be flanked by <num value="2">two</num> inferior powers who would be ever jealous, ever apprehensive of it, and who would seek alliances abroad to injure their more powerful neighbor and prejudice her commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503" />This would bring trouble on all. The <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203" authname="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States would not hesitate to form an alliance with <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685" authname="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504" />The border States would be in the meantime between upper and nether millstones — suspected by their Northern allies, hated by their Southern neighbors, and finally deprived of their own self-respect.--Indeed such an alliance on their part would be the signal for the exodus of their best people, causing the feebleness and desolation of a transition state, and would seal their destiny as mere tributaries to Northern affluence and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505" />How far superior would be the partition of the nation into <num value="2">two</num> great Republics on amicable relations with each other and with power to command the respect of the world and protect themselves! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506" /> But the <rs>Central Confederacy</rs> is an impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508" />And how can it be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509" />It is an impossibility; and the idea of such a Confederacy is an easy way to the fastening of the border States to the car of the <rs>North</rs> as powerless captives, to be, as long as the <rs>Union</rs> with them lasts, the tributaries to their aggrandizement and the supernumeraries of their grand political drama. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515" />Her waters would be filled with sails, and her rivers be indicated by the ever rising smoke of the fast-moving steam vessels actively conducting her commerce with all nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516" />Every city and town would be astir with the busy industry of art, and animated by a lively commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517" />All this would be supported by the <name>South</name> and <name>South</name>west, which would be wedded to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919" authname="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> by every tie that could bind them to her. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148" />The Pittsburg Post gives the following particulars of that extraordinary case: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149" /> About <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>, the residents not only of <placeName reg="Lawrenceville, Brunswick, Virginia" key="tgn,2112624" authname="tgn,2112624">Lawrenceville</placeName>, but some in <placeName reg="West Branch Susquehanna River, Pennsylvania, United States" key="tgn,2758145" authname="tgn,2758145">Alleghany</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013927" authname="tgn,7013927">Pittsburg</placeName>, were aroused by a terrible explosion, which seemed to be continuous and reverberative, lasting several seconds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150" />Investigation proved that the explosion originated from an infernal machine, which had been placed in the window-sill of a room in the lower part of <placeName><persName n="Hoveler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00707" reg="nearbymention:Hoveler,A.,,," authname="hoveler,a."><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Hoveler</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151" />The room contained <num value="2">two</num> beds, <num value="1">one</num> occupied by <persName n="Hoveler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00708" reg="nearbymention:Hoveler,A.,,," authname="hoveler,a."><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Hoveler</surname></persName> and wife, and the other (a trundle bed), by <num value="2">two</num> children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152" /><persName n="Hoveler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00709" reg="nearbymention:Hoveler,A.,,," authname="hoveler,a."><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Hoveler</surname></persName> had only retired about half an hour before, having been sitting at the window where the machine was placed awaiting the arrival of a physician, who had been sent for to minister to a member of the family then ill.--The occupants of the room were suddenly awakened by the shock, and found the room literally covered with fragments of glass and bullets, several of which were embedded in the wall, while the beds were also strewn with the leaden instruments of destruction.--A door opening in to another room gave vent to the charge, and permitted Mr. H. to remove his family from the suffocating atmosphere.-- By what seems an interposition of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952" authname="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, the design of the fiendish plotter against the lives of the innocent was frustrated, as none of the family were injured beyond a slight burn received by <num value="1">one</num> of the children. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153" /> There is a porch in front of the house, and the window where the machine was placed opens upon the porch from a recess at the end. The machine evidently consisted (from the fragments picked up) of a box made of inch-thick pine, about a foot long, <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> wide, and the same depth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154" />This was packed with powder and a number of bullets, (new, and of <num value="2">two</num> different sizes,) fastened up, and then bound securely with twine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155" />The firing was effected by a long fuse, which, after the box had been placed on the sill, was drawn along the railing of the porch, <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure>, and a match applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156" />The effect of the explosion of such a Satanic contrivance may be imagined. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157" /> The <rs n="window glass" type="product">window glass</rs> and sash were shattered to atoms, and scattered over the rooms, while pictures and other small articles were torn to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158" />The burning twine set fire to the trees outside, and ignited the bed clothing inside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159" />The room was filled with smoke and soot shaken from the chimney, and the explosion tore a shutter from its hinges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160" />In the morning <persName n="Hoveler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00710" reg="nearbymention:Hoveler,A.,,," authname="hoveler,a."><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Hoveler</surname></persName> picked up <num value="50">fifty</num> balls on the ground, and nearly as many in the room, and throughout the day persons visiting the scene found them all over the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161" />The box must have contained several <num value="100">hundred</num> balls, and it is indeed miraculous that no <num value="1">one</num> was injured by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162" />It is probable, however, that they were not so arranged in the casing as to give them full effect, and that the box was not strong enough to offer much resistance to the force of the explosion, thus permitting a large proportion of the missiles to fall outside, while those which entered the room fell with little force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163" />Marks of blood were observed upon the porch, and it is believed that the contriver of this fiendish projectile was himself injured by the explosion. </p> </div3>
