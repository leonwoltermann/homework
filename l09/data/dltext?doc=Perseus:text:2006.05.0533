<milestone unit="sentence" n="218" />We abstain from speculating on the heavy loss certain to have been incurred in the defeat of such magnitude, and likely enough to be counterpoised by an equally heavy damage to the winning side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219" />Merely on the ground, however, of the change of position, which is acknowledged, we entertain no doubt that this battle practically involves the raising of the siege of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225" />The impression which this great military event has made on <name>English</name> society is not to be mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226" />If there were before any who thought that the resistance of the <rs>South</rs> was likely to be overcome by the exploits of <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0" authname="mcclellan"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, they are now undeceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227" />It cannot be doubted that a battle of the highest importance has been fought, and that the <rs>Federal</rs> army has been thrown back a considerable distance — several miles indeed — from its former position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228" /> But if the <rs>Virginia</rs> campaign has ended in a manner which shows that the <rs>Confederates</rs> are able to carry on a long war, the fighting at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582" authname="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> shows that, even at isolated points, they are prepared to receive an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229" />The ambiguity of the telegraph prepared us to believe that the battle before <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582" authname="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> ended in a victory for the <rs>South</rs>.--The thing is now made clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230" />A Federal General, plainly ignorant of the enemy he was to attack, and the defences he was likely to meet, advanced with some <num value="1200">1,200</num> men to the attack of a battery, and he seems to have been as completely defeated as the <rs>British</rs> were at New Orleans, and perhaps much in the same manner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231" /> The moral to be deduced from these events is clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232" />There is probably, at the present moment, in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, not a single society where the defenders of this hateful and atrocious war could make themselves heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233" />The impartial opinion of every civilized nation is being more and more strongly expressed against the enterprise in which the <rs>Federals</rs> are embarked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234" />The orators of the <rs>Northern States</rs> may inveigh as much as they please against the interference of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom" authname="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, and the mob may shout scorn of <name>English</name> advice and defiance of <name>English</name> arms; but <name>English</name> opinion is after all, the opinion of the world, and we may hope that, in spite of affected indignation and high flown eloquence, the good sense which has uniformly marked our counsels in this affair may at length prevail. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235" /> We must repeat and repeat again our earnest recommendation to the <rs>Federals</rs> to put an end to this horrible war. What have they gained by it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236" />What can they ever gain by it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237" />Do they think that these men of their own race, whose exploits they are daily witnessing, can ever be so subjugated as to submit to the yoke which a Hunter and a Butler are preparing for them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238" />Can they, in fact, wish for such a consummation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239" />Do they not feel the common pride of humanity in the exploits of a gallant people, who are defending their homes by a display of the most transcendent valor and devotion.? There would be no disgrace in desisting from the hopeless and, consequently, wicked attempt to conquer and govern the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240" />Every <num value="1">one</num> knows that the <rs>Northern</rs> man is as good as the <rs>Southern</rs>, and that if any section of the late Union were invaded by the rest it would assuredly give the same proofs of unflinching resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241" />The whole difference between the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents is that the <rs>South</rs> is thoroughly in earnest, and fights as for life and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242" />This makes up for want of food, of arms, of medicines, of all that makes war easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243" />As long as this resolution lasts, and several <num value="1000000">millions</num> of people are in arms to resist subjugation, so long must the efforts of the <rs>North</rs> meet with the failure which has thus far attended the <rs>Virginia</rs> campaign of <dateStruct value="1862--" full="yes" authname="1862"><year reg="1862" full="yes">1862</year></dateStruct>. </p> </div4>

The dispersion of a large portion of the <rs>Federal</rs> army in expeditions and garrisons, simultaneous with the concentration of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> through the abandonment of a large number of its positions, constituted a new relation between the <num value="2">two</num> collective forces, the importance of which, it seems to us, has not been appreciated at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962" authname="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, It ought to have been clearly perceived that every Federal success in the outlying portions of the scene of war would tend to increase the difficulties of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0" authname="mcclellan"><roleName n="General" full="yes">Gen.</roleName> <surname full="yes">McClellan</surname></persName>, who should have been reinforced accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247" />This was not done, and a reverse is the natural consequence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248" /> Serious as this reverse of the <rs>Federals</rs> undoubtedly is, it would be a great mistake to see in it any decisive character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249" />The people of the <rs>North</rs> will be surprised, and possibly for the moment alarmed, at the defeat of the most numerous of their armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250" />But we do not expect that they will lose in a moment that proud consciousness of immensely superior strength which they have acquired by experience, and which they see reflected in the opinion of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251" />They will more probably ascribe their disasters to a misapplication of the resources they have placed at the disposal of the <rs>Government</rs>, and while increasing those resources from their boundless store, will take precautions for their better employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252" />Hitherto checks have only provoked them to mightier exertions; and, without paradox, at the very moment when their largest army has suffered a reverse, the <rs>North</rs> knows itself stronger as the <rs>South</rs> knows itself weaker than at any previous stage of the war. While, therefore, we recognize the importance of the <rs>Confederate</rs> success; we see in it an event which is likely to draw out rather than shorten the war; for whether we suppose the <rs>North</rs> to be fighting to restore the <rs>Union</rs> to its former territorial integrity, or simply, as some advise, for a frontier, it is certain that its citizens cannot afford to retire from the contest until they have conclusively established their superiority. </p> </div4> </div3>
