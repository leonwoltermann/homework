<p> He regarded the peace proposition as the only <num value="1">one</num> that can restore harmony, and he was glad that this idea was the prominent <num value="1">one</num> pervading the minds of the majority of the <rs>American</rs> people.--[Applause.] The war now being waged has not become general because of the long suffering of the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100" />Every day of the continuance of this war brings us nearer to a despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101" />The training of the <rs>American</rs> people requires freedom of speech, of religion, and of the press, and by the blessing of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> they shall have it. [Loud applause.] </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107" />The country, according to all human eyes, is now in the throes of death, and the fitting inscription on its tomb must be, "Died by the cowardice of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>." [Applause.] The <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> had been us true to its revolutionary principles as the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> had been false to its principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108" />During the last <num value="3">three</num> abominable years they have every day been abandoning the doctrines on which that party was founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110" />[Laughter.] What is the meaning of the word conservative?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111" />Merely a mitigated abolitionist, or a whole coward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112" />There are but <num value="2">two</num> forces in the contest — absolutism, and the right of the people to rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113" />There was no difference between peaceful self-government and coercion; no alternative between Lincolnism and distinct Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114" />Though the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> may change, democracy itself can no more change than the principles of morality can be altered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115" />The leaders may be frightened off, but the principle itself remains immutable as at the moment when the country was plunged into a vortex of fratricidal blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116" />[Applause.] He would undertake to say that the present Administration was a total depravity.
