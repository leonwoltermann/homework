<milestone unit="sentence" n="18" />The object of the expedition was for the purpose of taking away the tobacco purchased in this city by agents of the <rs>French Government</rs> previous to the war, the arrival of which at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477" authname="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> had been delayed from some cause unknown to us.
