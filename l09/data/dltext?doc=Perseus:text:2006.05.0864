<milestone unit="sentence" n="110" />For a distance, roughly guessed, of <measure n="30yards" type="distance">thirty yards</measure>, the wall is little less than a steep hill that descends from the parapet to the water's edge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111" />This, too, is a ghastly pile of the once magnificent shape, from which stand out, in almost sickening aspect, fragments of guns, gun carriages, masses of machinery, balls, bolts, rammers, spongers, all bound and mixed together with the iron, brick and mortar, in lumps and in dust, that have been wrenched from their long time honored places.
