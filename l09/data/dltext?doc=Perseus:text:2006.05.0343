<milestone unit="sentence" n="182" />I respectfully suggest that authority should be given to the <rs>President</rs> to send commissioners with the army, with power to exercise all the functions of local government wherever the civil authority has ceased to exist, and especially to enforce the obligations of contracts, and the collection of debts due to loyal creditors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183" /> As stated in my last report, at the commencement of this rebellion, the <rs>Government</rs> found itself deficient in arms and munitions of war, through the bad faith of these intrusted with their control during the preceding Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184" />The armory at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154" authname="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> having been destroyed to prevent its possession and use by the rebels, the <rs>Government</rs> was compelled to rely upon the singed armory at <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532" authname="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, and upon private establishments, for a supply of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185" />Every effort has been made to increase the capacity of that armory, the greatest product of which, prior to there troubles, had never exceeded see muskets per mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186" />In charge of an energetic and able ordnance officer, the force being doubled, and operations vigorously prosecuted day and night, there were made at this establishment, during the past month of <dateStruct value="-10-" full="yes" authname="--10"><month reg="10" full="yes">October</month></dateStruct>, a total of <num value="6900">6,900</num> muskets; and it is confidently expected that <num value="10000">10,000</num> will be manufactured during the present month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187" />On a recent visit, with a view to enlarge the capacity of the armory, I directed the purchase of a large quantity of machinery already finished, which, when put in operation, will enable this establishment to produce during the next year <num value="200000">200,000</num> stand of the justly celebrated <name type="weapon">Springfield rifles</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188" />I respectfully suggest the recommendation of a liberal appropriation by Congress for the purpose of yet further increasing the capacity of this armory, believing that it can be made sufficient to supply all the muskets and rifles which the <rs>Government</rs> may hereafter need in any contingency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189" />Located in a healthful country, in the midst of an industrious and ingenious people, where competent workmen can always be obtained without difficulty, and sufficiently near to all the materials needed in the manufacture of arms, it is at the same time accessible to every part or the country by water and railway communication. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190" /> After having made contracts for arms with the private establishments in this country, it was deemed necessary by the <rs>President</rs>, to insure a speedy and ample supply, to send a special agent to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe," authname="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, with funds to the amount of <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of dollars, to purchase more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191" />I am gratified to state that he has made arrangements for a large number of arms, part of which have already been delivered the remainder will be shipped by successive steamers, until all shall have been received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192" /> Combinations among manufacturers, importers, and agents, for the sale of arms, have, in many cases, caused an undue increase in prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193" />To prevent advantage being thus taken of the necessities of the <rs>Government</rs>, collectors of customs have been directed to deliver to the agents of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> all arms and munitions that may be imported into the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194" /> The demand for arms has called into existence numerous establishments for their manufacture throughout the loyal portion of the country, and it has been the policy of this Department to encourage the development of the capital, enterprise, and skill of our people in this direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195" />The Government should never have less than a <num value="1000000">million</num> of muskets in its arsenals, with a corresponding proportion of arms and equipments for artillery and cavalry.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197" /> I recommend that application be made to Congress for authority to establish a national foundry for the manufacture of <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> at such point as may afford the greatest facilities for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198" />While a sufficient number of cannon, perhaps, could be procured from private manufactories, the possession of a national establishment would lead to experiments which would be useful to the country, and prevent imposition in prices by the accurate knowledge that would be acquired of the real value of work of this character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199" /> In my last report I called attention to the fact that legislation was necessary for the reorganization, upon a uniform basis of the militia of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200" />Some general plan should be provided by Congress, in aid of the <name>States</name>, by which our militia can be organized, armed, and disciplined, and made effective at any moment for immediate service.--If thoroughly trained in time of peace, when occasion demands, it may be converted into a vast army, confident in its discipline, and unconquerable in its patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201" />In the absences of any general system of organization, upwards of <num value="700000">700,000</num> men have already been brought into the field; and, in view of the alacrity and enthusiasm that have been displayed, I do not hesitate to express the belief that no combination of events can arise in which this country will not be able not only to protect itself, but contrary to its policy, which is peace with all the world, to enter upon aggressive operations against any Power that may intermeddle with our domestic affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202" />A committee should be appointed by Congress, with authority to sit during the recess, to devise and report a plan for the general organization of the militia of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149" authname="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203" /> It is of great importance that immediate attention should be given to the condition of our fortifications upon the seaboard and the takes, and upon our exposed frontiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204" />They should at once be placed in perfect condition for successful defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205" />Aggressions are seldom made upon a nation ever ready to defend its honor and to repelinsuits; and we should show to the world that while engaged in shelling disturbance at home we are able to protect ourselves against attacks from abroad. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215" /> I recommend that the system of promotions which prevails in the regular service he applied to the volunteer forces in the respective States; restricting, however, the promotion to men actually in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216" />At present each Governor selects and appoints the officers for the troops furnished by his State, and complaint is, not unfrequently made that when vacancies occur in the field, men of interior qualifications are placed in command over those in the ranks who are their superiors in military experience and capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217" />The advancement of merit should be the leading principle to all promotions, and the volunteer soldier should be given to understand that preferment will be the sure reward of intelligence, fidelity and distinguished service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218" /> The course above recommended has been pursued by this Department, and it is my attention, so far us is in my power, to continue a system, which cannot fall to have a most beneficial effect upon the entire service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219" /> By existing laws and regulations an officer of the regular army ranks an officer of volunteers of the same grade, notwithstanding the commission of the latter may be of antecedent limit the opportunity for distinction of volunteer officers, and a change should be made by which seniority of commission should confer the right of command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220" /> I submit for reflection the question whether the distinction between regulars and volunteers, which now exists, should be permitted to continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221" />The efficiency of the army, it appears to me, might be greatly increased by a consolidation of the <num value="2">two</num> during the continuance of the war, which, combining both forces, would constitute them <num value="1">one</num> grand army of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222" /> Recruiting for the regular army has not been attended with that success which was anticipated, although a large number of men have entered this branch of the service.--While it is admitted that soldiers in the regular army, under the control of officers of military education and experience, are generally better cared for than those in the volunteer service, it is certain that the popular preference is largely given to the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223" />Young men evidently prefer to enter a corps officered by their friends and acquaintances, and beside the county granted to volunteers in most of the <name>States</name>, inducements are often directly offered to them by those whose commissions depend upon their success in obtaining recruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224" />In addition, the volunteer is allowed to draw his full pay of <measure n="13dollars" type="currency">$13</measure> per month, while by law <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">$2</measure> per month his deducted from the pay of the regular, to be returned to him at the end of his term of service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225" /> In my judgment this law should be repealed, and the regular soldier be allowed to receive his full pay when due. He should also, receive either a reasonable bounty upon enlisting, or an advance of <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure> of the <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> which a law of the last session of Congress grants to regulars and volunteers on the expiration of their periods of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226" />This would doubtless stimulate enlistments, as it would enable the soldier to make some provision for those dependent upon him for support until he receives his pay </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227" /> By the act approved <date value="1864-08-05" authname="1864-08-05">August 5, 1864</date>, the <rs>President</rs> is authorized to appoint as many aids to <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-Generals</rs> of the regular army, acting in the field, as he may deem proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228" />The number of aids, in my opinion, should be limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229" />and no more should be allowed in each <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> than can be advantageously employed upon his own roper staff Much expense would thus be saved, and the <rs>Executive</rs> and this department would he relieved of applications very embarrassing from their nature and extent. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231" />In view of the injurious operation of this law, and of the facilities which it opens to frauds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232" />I respectfully urge its early repeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233" />Applications for discharges of minors can then be determined either by this Department, in accordance with such regulations as experience may have shown to be necessary, or by the civil tribunals of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234" /> The employment of regimental bands should be limited, the proportion of musicians now allowed by law being too great, and their usefulness not at all commensurate with their heavy expense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235" /> Corporations, like individuals, are liable to be governed by selfish motives in the absence of competition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236" />An instance of this kind occurred in the management of the railroads between <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352" authname="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237" />The sum of <measure n="6dollars" type="currency">$6</measure> was charged upon that route for the transportation of each soldier from New York to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352" authname="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238" />As this rate seemed extravagant to the department, when considered in connection with the great increase of trade upon these roads, made necessary by the wants of the <rs>Government</rs>, inquiry was made concerning the expediency of using the roads from New York to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352" authname="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> via <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694" authname="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239" />The result was an arrangement by which troops were brought by the last named route at <measure n="4dollars" type="currency">$4</measure> each; and, as a consequence, this rate was at once necessarily adopted by all the railroads in the loyal States, making a saving to the <rs>Government</rs> of <num value="33">thirty-three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent, in all its transportation of soldiers, and at the same time giving to the railroads, through increased business, a liberal compensation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484" />Further advices, received yesterday, confirmed the report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485" />The particulars, as we learned them from an authentic source, are as follows: </p> </q></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486" /> Early <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> a movement was discovered among the <rs>Federals</rs> on the <rs type="place">Island</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487" />Soon the boats commenced pushing out from shore for the fleet, and up to nightfall some <num value="24">twenty-four</num> boats, containing from <num value="40">forty</num> to <num value="50">fifty</num> men each, had left the <rs type="place">Island</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488" />The embarkation continued through <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. <num value="1">One</num> ship load had left <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> for the <rs>South</rs>, and <num value="1">one</num> yesterday, bearing Northward. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489" /> We are left to conjecture the cause of this sudden departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490" />It may be that they feared an attack and were unwilling to meet us in the tug of war, with gleaming steal and face to face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491" />Another conjecture is, that finding an attack on the main land, via the frowning walls of <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia" authname="tgn,2024563">Fort Pulaski</placeName>, rather an impracticable affair, they concluded to concentrate their force at a more assailable point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492" />Still another is, that the forces were originally thrown on the island for the purpose of erecting the necessary defences to control the entrance to our harbor, and having finished the work were taken back to the rendezvous on <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 303" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina" authname="tgn,2391938">Hilton Head</placeName>, or to construct fortifications at some other point. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494" /> <dateStruct full="yes"><day type="name" full="yes">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> a large ship, equal in size to the New York and <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487" authname="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> steamers was seen from the fort to enter an inlet to the <rs>South</rs>, supposed to be <placeName reg="Warsaw, Gallatin, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041838" authname="tgn,2041838">Warsaw</placeName>, and run up several miles.
