<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67" /> It must be known to the <rs type="place">House</rs> that even before the war began that district was occupied by hostile troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68" />From that day until now not a Confederate soldier has ever been within the district, or within a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> of the place of my residence, except as a prisoner in the hands of the enemy.--Even before our ordinance of secession was ratified, there of my constituents who desired to join the army of the <rs>State</rs> were compelled to escape by stratagem through lines guarded by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69" />So brief was the warning, so unexpected was the invasion, and so difficult was escape, that only a few were within our lines at the time of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71" />At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> approach of invasion they were compelled to choose between submission and exile.--They promptly gave up their homes, property, and nearly all that men hold dear, saving for themselves nothing but the precious liberty of serving their country during this terrible war. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109" /> I read with unusual interest and satisfaction the debate which occurred in the <name>Senate</name> on the <dateStruct value="--15" full="yes" authname="---15"><day reg="15" full="yes">15th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, upon the resolution of <persName n="Trumbull,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,nomatch:0" authname="trumbull"><roleName n="Mister" full="yes">Mr.</roleName> <surname full="yes">Trumbull</surname></persName>, and desire to express my thanks for the sentiments and thoughts which the occasion elicited from you. My convictions and sympathies are with you thoroughly when you say, "I do not believe that it (imprisonment upon <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">lettres de caches</hi></foreign>) promotes the purposes of those who desire to see this Union brought together again an object, of all others to me the most desirable, if it be possible." </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110" /> In my estimation, the mover of the inquiry deserves the gratitude of freemen everywhere, and only utters truth with force when he declares that "the power, without charge, without examination, without opportunity of reply, at the click of the telegraph, to arrest a man in a peaceable portion of the country and imprison him" is "of the essence of despotism." And yet the public mind thus far would seem to have been scarcely more roused by current events of this character than it was years ago when we received accounts of similar incarcerations ordered by the father of the now deposed <rs type="role">King</rs> of the <num value="2">Two</num> <unclear> Sicilles.</unclear> How incredible it will appear hereafter, when history shall be written up, that at this period of the <rs>Republic</rs> the constitutional safe guards of personal liberty could have been so easily and with so little apparent concern <unclear>swet</unclear> away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112" />I replied without delay, and, so far as I am personally affected, may. I trust, well leave the matter in quietness upon the files of the <name>Department</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113" />It is my belief, however, that no recent measure has been fraught with more mischief than the issuing of <hi rend="italics">lettres de cachet,</hi> and consequent arrests and imprisonments in violation of the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and that the earlier the system is effectually checked the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114" />It will be for the <rs>Government</rs> and the country, as well as for the subjects of oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115" />The evidence is abundant to show that the plea of <hi rend="italics">necessity,</hi> except in the presence or immediate neighborhood of hostile armies, where the administration of law, under its usual forms, may be <unclear>inevitakly</unclear> suspended, is not graciously accepted by the mass of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116" />Union, without security for personal liberty, is not the <rs>Union</rs> which they have cherished, and to the restoration of which they took with earnest desire and hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117" />Nothing, perhaps, could express more clearly their views on this point than the language of the great modern historian, who died at a comparatively recent period, leaving his work incomplete.

Who in our land will affirm that any other doctrine is worthy of those who hold their rights under a solemn written charter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119" />It is cheering to know that inquiry has been moved in the right quarter, and that able and fearless men are stirred by a sense of what is due to our fellow citizens, who have been imprisoned without assignment of cause and discharged without explanation; and yet more, to such as are still in confinement, and precluded by guards and prison-bolts from the privilege of the "great writ of liberty," and thus of confronting before a competent judicial tribunal suggestion of crime, which the act of <sic>imprisoment</sic> itself implies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120" />Of this latter class, I believe, from my knowledge of the man, are not a few worthy sons of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516" authname="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, who love the <rs>Union</rs> as you do, and who have striven not to destroy, but to preserve it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249" />Young, beautiful, with all that could adorn the character of woman in mind and disposition, she had attached to her many warm and devoted friends in the home of her childhood and in the later home of her adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250" />Ever modest and retiring in her manners, sincere is her friendship, firm, in her convictions of right and of duty, without guile, gentle, loving, kind she was a bright example of a pure and lovely woman. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253" />For nearly <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> she had been a constant sufferer to the ravages of disease; and yet in the midst of excruciating pain and of weariness, during this long period, and the chilling prospects of approaching death, deferred from year to year, contrary to the expectations of her physicians and friends, she was never known to murmur, having borne her every affliction with a degree of fortitude and <name>Christian</name> resignation rarely equalled never excelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257" />Her voice had now become extremely feeble, and soon after she quietly sank into a peaceful slumber; awakening, she cast a last fond look of affection upon her companion and the dear friends gathered around her bed side, and as a gentle and wearied infant unconsciously falls to sleep, she closed forever her lovely eyes, and without the slightest struggle or the least apparent pain breathed her last breath calmly, softly sweetly; as her pure spirit passed from earth to Daven. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259" />The <name>Christian</name> experience of the deceased, her glorious triumph in death, and the manifestations of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to her do parting soul, are lessons of mystery, of beauty, of awful power, of tender and eternal eloquence, upon which we could dwell, not blinded by tears, but looking up through sunlight and smiling skies praising <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who turneth night into day and maketh even the mystery and shadow of-death a light to all believers. </p> 
<p>
