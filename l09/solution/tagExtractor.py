1. Analyze categories of tagged data:
    - <persName> (552,453); <placeName> (402,419); <orgName> (164,988); <rs> (353,521) /https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-rs.html/; 
    - How to determine these?!
        - Advice: always check whether the tagging is actually good;
        - if there is no tagging (or it is not reliable), alternative methods must be used to extract your data (named entity recognition)
2. Extract tagged data in those categories
    - data format: ID, date, item (item may take more than one column)
3. as a starting point, we can use the script with which we reformatted the data from the Dispatch into other formats
